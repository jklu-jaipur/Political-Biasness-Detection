79,,"HYDERABAD: Immediately after TRS swept the civic elections in Telangana on Saturday, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao told reporters at the party headquarters that his government would pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the state assembly. This would make Telangana the fourth state to pass such a resolution after Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan.

He also revived talk of a federal front and said both the Congress and BJP had failed the country.

""It may not happen immediately, but I believe that the front will form the next government at the Centre."" He added that he supported abrogation of Article 370 and opposed the CAA in the interest of the nation. TRS had voted against CAA in Parliament.

Stressing that CAA was ""100% a big mistake"", he said that he would mobilise support of like-minded regional party leaders and the 15-odd chief ministers, who are against CAA, and hold a conference in Hyderabad soon. ""If required a public meeting with 10 lakh people will be organized in the city,"" he added.

KCR also said that in his view, the Supreme Court should take up CAA suo moto and scrap it. ""I request the prime ministers to withdraw CAA as it is against the preamble of the Constitution,"" he said. ""The image of our country is at stake globally.""

""Instead of focussing on the important issues like recession, literacy and poverty, the government was raking up the Hindu-Muslim issue,"" he said. ""Is it good if you send Muslims out of the country? What happens if Hindus living in outside India are asked to leave? Besides, BJP is already losing one states after another. It lost Jharkhand recently and reports indicate that AAP may win Delhi,"" the chief minister said.

The TRS supremo blamed the Centre for the economic slowdown in the country. ""Economists have been expressing concern over the recession and millions of people have lost their jobs. The states too were suffering because of the economic slowdown.""

He added that the NDA government has not released Rs 34,000 crore to states towards GST relief and other devolution of funds. ""The state government is yet to release Rs 1,131 crore and another Rs 2,812 crore towards IGST. I will write a letter to the Prime Minister to release the amount apart from sending a delegation to New Delhi to build pressure on the Centre,"" the CM said.",,,

Gorakhpur:

The maternal uncle of Dr Kafeel Khan, who was recently arrested for allegedly making inflammatory statements during anti-Citizenship Law protests, was shot dead in front of his house at Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur, police said on Sunday.

Dr Nusratullah Warsi aka Dada, 55, a property dealer, was shot dead on Saturday night at around 10:45 pm and an FIR against two people was filed after a written complaint of his family. He was returning from his lawyer's house, a few metres away from his own, when a man shot him in his head, killing him on the spot.

Police said it appears to be a case of murder due to monetary and property dispute and they are searching for both the accused. Three teams have been constituted to investigate the case.

""On the written complaint of family members, case of murder against one Imammuddin and Anil Sonkar has been registered and police has initiated probe and is searching for both the accused. Police met the women in their house and is interrogating them,"" Circle Officer VP Singh said.

Dr Kafeel Khan, suspended doctor of Gorakhpur BRD Medical College, was last month arrested under charges of giving a provocative speech during a protest against the CAA and NRC at Aligarh Muslim University and was later charged with the National Security Act (NSA).

Dr Kafeel Khan had last month raised apprehension in a Mumbai court about being killed in an ""encounter"" by the Uttar Pradesh police after claiming that he had been ""falsely"" implicated in the case by them.

The paediatrician had come to the limelight in 2017 when a controversy broke out after the death of over 60 children in less than a week at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, where he was posted.

82,,"Ramlila Maidan: An AAP supporter at the oath ceremony of Arvind Kejriwal in New Delhi (AFP)

Arvind Kejriwal today thanked the people of Delhi for ensuring their ""son"" returns as Chief Minister of the national capital for a third time. After taking oath at the historic Ramlila Maidan today, Mr Kejriwal addressed thousands of people, who cheered for him as he started speaking.

""Your son has taken the oath of Chief Minister for a third time. This is not my win, this is your victory. This is the victory of every Delhi wala, every mother, every sister, every youth, every student, every family in Delhi,"" Mr Kejriwal said.

""In the last five years we have tried to work on how to ensure every family can become happier, give some relief in their lives, how to develop Delhi fast... In the next five years our effort on this will go on,"" he said.

""Everyone, call your villages and tell them 'our son has become Chief Minister, there is no need to worry',"" the Chief Minister said, drawing applause from the crowd.

The Aam Aadmi Party won 62 seats in the Delhi assembly election - a near repeat of its 2015 tally of 67 seats at the end of one of the most polarising campaigns in the backdrop of the anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protests.

The national capital has a large population of people from all walks of life who have come from outside the city. Mr Kejriwal's message today that they should ""call home"" to tell their ""son"" is the Chief Minister is being seen as his acknowledgement of their support.

""Some people voted AAP, some voted for BJP, some for Congress, but when I took oath as Chief Minister, I am the Chief Minister of everyone, of AAP, BJP, Congress and other parties. I have never been biased against anyone, have never said 'I won't help you because you voted for BJP'. I will work for everyone. In areas in the city where the BJP is strong, I have put water pipes, improved roads,"" Mr Kejriwal said.

In 2015 too, Mr Kejriwal's oath-taking ceremony took place at the Ramlila Maidan. It was held on February 14, coinciding with Valentine's Day. In 2013 after his party's first poll victory, the swearing-in ceremony was again held at the same venue.

83,,"Prime Minister says these decisions were necessary in national interest.

Despite international pressure, the government will continue to stand by its decision to revoke Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and introduce the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Sunday.

He said the country had ""awaited"" these decisions for many years. ""In national interest, these decisions were necessary,"" Mr. Modi said at an event in his parliamentary constituency Varanasi.

""Aur duniyabhar ke sare dawaabo ke bawajood, in faislo par hum kayam hai aur kayam rahenge [Despite the various international pressures, we stand by these decisions and will continue to stand by them,"" Mr. Modi said. The country was now taking decisions that were always left behind in the past, he added.

The Prime Minister's tough talk assumed significance in view of protests against the CAA in various parts of the country.

In Varanasi, Mr. Modi launched projects worth ƒ??1,250 crore. He unveiled the statue of Deendayal Upadhyay, which, at 63 feet, is the largest statue of the leader in the country, as per the government. The Prime Minister also dedicated to the nation the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Memorial Centre.

Mr. Modi flagged off the third corporate train, Mahakaal Express, which links three Jyotirling pilgrim centres -- Varanasi, Ujjain and Omkareshwar.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Modi attended the closing ceremony of the centenary celebration of Jagadguru Vishwaradhya Gurukul at Jangamwadi Mutt and released the translated version of 'Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth' in 19 languages. He also launched the 'Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth' mobile app.

Citing certain key decisions of his government, Mr. Modi referred to the trust set up for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and said it would work ""rapidly.""

He said that after setting up of the trust, the work on the construction of 'Ram dham' would start fast and added that his government had also decided to transfer 67 acres of land to the trust.

He also inaugurated a 430-bed superspeciality government hospital.

Mr. Modi said that in the past few years, ƒ??25,000 crore worth developmental projects had either been completed or were going on at a fast pace in Varanasi.

Roadway, highway, waterway and railway had been given top priority by the government and the Purvanchal Expressway work was going on at fast speed in Uttar Pradesh.

The Prime Minister also laid emphasis on better connectivity of heritage and religious sites, saying tourism would be the main source of making the country a $5 trillion economy.",,,
84,,"GUWAHATI: A local court on Monday extended by four days the police remand of JNU student Sharjeel Imam who was arrested on charges of sedition and brought to the state last week.

Imam was brought to Assam from New Delhi on February 20 and produced in ourt which had initially sent him to four days' police remand, they said.

Upon the expiry of his police remand, he was on Monday produced before the Kamrup (Metro) Chief Judicial Magistrate.

The student, who came into the limelight during the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, was arrested from Bihar's Jehanabad on January 28 for allegedly making inflammatory speeches at the Jamia Millia Islamia University and in Aligarh.

Imam was slapped with a sedition case after his speeches went viral on social media wherein he was heard allegedly speaking about Assam's possible secession from the country in the wake of the CAA.

A case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) has been registered against him in Assam.

On February 18, the Delhi Police had named Imam as an ""instigator"" in its charge sheet filed against 17 people in a case related to violence during protests against the CAA at New Friends Colony near Jamia Millia Islamia last year.

Meanwhile, Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the state government is keeping a tab on the developments related to Imam's interrogation.

On reports claiming that Imam had contact with AIUDF supremo Badruddin Ajmal for some years, Sarma told reporters, ""I have seen it in the media only.... If there is any connection found between them for unlawful activities, we will take necessary action.""",,,
85,,"Hyderabad: The NDA government has not defined whether the USD 5 trillion dollars economy it aims to achieve is real GDP or nominal, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said on Saturday and claimed real GDP would not touch the figure at the current growth level by 2024 or 2025.

Chidambaram, who spoke on the Union Budget at a meeting organised by the party here, hit out at the government for allegedly proving to be incompetent in managing the economy. ""Firstly, the Modi government has still not defined whether 5 trillion dollars is real GDP or nominal.

Secondly, while Modi keeps on saying 2024, the economic survey, in the introduction, the goalpost has been shifted from 2024 to 2025. Be that as it may, at the current level of growth, real GDP will not touch 5 trillion dollars either by 2024 or 2025,"" the former Finance minister said.

Chidambaram was replying to a query on the government's ambitious target of USD 5 trillion economy. Interacting with the audience, he said the NDA government should not ""clutter"" the tax structure by seeking to introduce separate systems, one giving exemptions and other not.

Asked by a member of the audience whether there is a possibility of the government withdrawing various tax exemptions leading to the common man not having options to save money and tax, he felt that there was still confusion within the government on the matter.

""Even if all the income tax payers opt for the new system, the maximum benefit will be Rs 40,000 crore.What is Rs 40,000 crore when India's GDP is almost 2.7 trilllion dollars,"" he said. The impact would be so minimal that it won't make a big difference, he claimed.

Noting that the IT exemptions are savings, he said their withdrawal would lead to a decline in the savings habit which is not good for the country. ""More than anything else, I don't think the tax structure should be cluttered like this. You don't have anywhere a tax structure, system A, system B, system A for exemptions...Without exemptions.

I think it is cluttering up tax system. I would not have done it. The sooner they clarify what their intention is, the better,"" he said.

On the proposed disinvestment in LIC, he said there was no clarity whether the government would list or disinvest the insurance behemoth. ""Without clarity about whether they are listing or disinvesting. I cannot comment on it. But on LIC, unless they convince me why they want to disinvest, our present position is we are deeply suspicious of their motives to disinvest LIC,"" he said.

Chidambaram, who lashed out at the Union Budget for allegedly failing to lead the economy on the path of progress and job creation, alleged that the Modi government was like a helpless doctor who failed to diagnose the illness of a patient and treat him effectively.

""Altogether, the bottomline is we have a patient who is extremely ill. Doctor has proved himself incompetent. Diagnosis of the doctor is hopelessly wrong,"" he said.

People who diagnosed the illness correctly like Dr Arvind Subramanian, former Chief Economic Adviser, were allowed to go from the government, he said.""Not having diagnosed the illness of the patient, the doctor is helpless. The least the doctor can do is to say...I am sorry.

We made mistake, will Dr Manmohan Singh come and advise us,"" he said.

Asked whether it is true that the country spends one per cent GDP to keep 950,000 troops in Kashmir, he said there were more troops there than necessary. ""I think we are keeping many, many more troops in Kashmir than I would ever accept as necessary. I think it is wrong. We should thin out our troops deployment in Kashmir.

More than that, I think we should give back the freedom to the people of the Kashmir valley,"" Chidambaram said.

Slamming the Centre for invoking the Public Safety Act against former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah to keep them in detention for upto a further two years, he said ""there cannot be a greater outrage, a greater assault on liberty than what they have done.

I think all of us should collectively pray for that the freedom of the people of Kashmir, the 75 lakh people of Kashmir valley, is restored,"" he added.",,,
86,,"In some respite relief for the people of Delhi-NCR, the Uttar Pradesh Police on Friday reopened a key route that links Noida with Delhi's Kalindi Kunj.

To ease congestion due to protests at Shaheen Bagh, the UP Police reopened the road leading from Kalindi Kunj towards Faridabad. The stretch from Noida's Mahamaya flyover to Delhi and Faridabad has been reopened, sources in the UP Police said.

The Shaheen Bagh-Kalindi Kunj road in southeast Delhi has been blocked for over two months due to ongoing protests against CAA.

The stretch of Shaheen Bagh to Kalindi Kunj road which is about two to three kilometres has commercial centres housing shops and restaurants. The road ends at Atlanta Water Park. The Shaheen Bagh-Kalindi Kunj road is parallel to the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway which is used by a large number of commuters between Delhi and Noida.

Even as protesters claimed that the all the roads that are close to Shaheen Bagh-Kalindi Kunj road like the GD Birla road, Kalindi Kunj bridge, Amrapali Road, Okhla Barrage Road, Okhla Bird Sanctuary Road, Dadri main road and Noida-Greater Noida Expressway were open, the attention shifted to Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch.

Advocate Amit Sahni had earlier approached the Delhi High Court seeking directions to the Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which was blocked by anti-CAA protesters on December 15 last year.

Kolkata Police on Monday cleared path for senior Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) leader and union Home Minister Amit Shah's public meeting on March 1, 2020 in Kolkata.

BJP had written to Kolkata Police on February 20, 2020 seeking permission to hold a public meeting at Shahid Minar Grounds congratulating him for Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Earlier, they had written Army's Eastern Command seeking permission as the land belongs to Defence Ministry. While the Army had granted permission, Kolkata Police communicated to the organisers of the BJP on Monday that they can hold the rally.

However, the organisers need to comply with Calcutta High Court's order prohibiting use of microphones and holding rallies or meetings in residential areas which might disturb examinees appearing for board examinations during this period.

""Kolkata Police has granted us permission to hold the rally. There will be no problem for students who are appearing for board examinations as Shahid Minar grounds is far from any residential areas.

88,,"NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal, engineer, civil servant and Delhi's man with a development agenda, is the David who slayed the mighty Goliath for the second time in five years.

The Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party is poised to win 63 of Delhi's 70 seats, leaving the BJP with seven and decimating the Congress, overcoming the BJP's divisive campaign.

Nine years ago, Kejriwal slipped into the political frame behind Anna Hazare during the Lokpal movement in 2011 before quickly enlarging his canvas, first as a satyagrah activist and then as founder of the cleverly named Aam Aadmi Party that took on the might of the BJP to reclaim Delhi for a third time on Tuesday.

The name of his party as carefully chosen as his public persona perhaps, Delhi's 51-year-old chief minister is the embodiment of the everyday man but one who has tailored his politics and campaign in keeping with the times.

As he emerged on the victory stage to loud cheers from his AAP supporters and shouted ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"", ""Inquilab Zindabad"" and ""Vande Mataram"" before saying ""I love you"" to Delhiites, many remembered the earnest activist who went on a hunger strike for a Lokpal bill in 2011.

The year after, in 2012, he started his political party and emerged as a mascot of an alternative brand of politics - and the 'aam aadmi' politician with his muffler casually wrapped around his neck, and sometimes his head, oversized shirts and open toed sandals.

Though his ambitions to make the AAP a national party have not met with much success, the Delhi chief minister's hat is one that will stay -- for the next five years at least.

His effort to be seen as a direct challenger to Narendra Modi came a cropper in 2014 when he contested the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi. He tried to make an electoral dent in Punjab and Goa in 2017 but that didn't work either. So Delhi it is for the moment.

In 2013, he became chief minister but only for 49 days, images of him sleeping in his utilitarian Wagon R while on 'dharna' for a Jan Lokpal (ombudsman) wrapped in a cotton quilt against the cold winter nights making the front pages.

Battling allegations of being autocratic and unyielding in his politics, Kejriwal resigned soon after, only to bide his time till 2015 when he scripted a stunning win to bag 67 of Delhi's 70 seats.

Earning the moniker 'mufflerman' for his fondness for the muffler, Kejriwal runs his party with the proverbial iron fist and has learnt to temper his aggression, say people close to him.

Notwithstanding the electoral triumph for BJP in the May Lok Sabha polls, the IIT graduate has managed to anchor a campaign that wooed all sections in the city.

He announced in the beginning of the campaign that he will run a positive campaign fought on the basis of his government's development work in the last five years.

His main poll planks were schemes such as free bus travel for women in DTC buses, free 200 units of electricity, installation of 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras and free 20,000 litres of water.

During the election campaign, Kejriwal attacked BJP on several occasions, asking who is their chief ministerial candidate.

He was careful, however, to not speak out too clearly on the anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh, the centrepiece of the BJP's campaign.

He was called a ""terrorist"" by BJP leaders, but Kejriwal hit back saying voters could back the BJP if they thought so or opt for his party if they view him as a son of Delhi.

Born on August 16, 1968 in Hisar in Haryana to Gobind Ram Kejriwal and Gita Devi, Kejriwal is a man of simple tastes.

His family is always by his side.

Kejriwal, who lives with his parents, wife Sunita and two children, is often seen going out for a quiet meal or the occasional film. Both daughter Harshita and son Pulkit are IIT products.

On Tuesday, the self confessed film buff and fond husband told his cheering supporters from the victory dais that it was Sunita's birthday.

A strict vegetarian who prefers home-made food, Kejriwal is married to Sunita, who is also an Indian Revenue Service officer and his batchmate. He is known to be an ardent practitioner of Vipassana, and seldom misses his yoga and meditation sessions.

The Ramon Magsaysay award winner was part of Team Anna that also included India's first IPS officer and now Puducherry governor Kiran Bedi and lawyer Prashant Bhushan.

He was the civil society representative member of the committee constituted by the government to draft the Jan Lokpal bill, following the campaign for introduction of the anti-graft legislation.

Kejriwal did a degree in Mechanical Engineering graduate from IIT Kharagpur.

He joined Tata Steel in 1989 and, after working for three years, resigned in 1992 to take up the Union Public Service Commission examination which he cleared to become an IRS officer. He also worked with Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata.

Kejriwal worked with people in slums through an NGO called Parivartan he set up with his confidant Manish Sisodia.

His efforts towards the enactment of the RTI Act to empower the poorest citizens of India won him the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership in 2006.

In February 2006, after resigning as joint commissioner in the Income Tax Department, he became a full-time activist and started another NGO, Public Cause Research Foundation, with his award money as a corpus fund.

Will this man with many accomplishments manage to break out of Delhi to extend his political reach to other parts of the country?

That's the challenge facing the AAP today.",,,
89,,"Buried in countless discussions on the failure of hate campaign against Shaheen Bagh and the victory of the Aam Aadmi Party's politics of ""kaam"" has been the actual role of the women of Shaheen Bagh. The Union Home Minister's exhortation to deliver ""electric current"" to Shaheen Bagh, the chanting of ""goli maro"" and the actual attacks by stray shooters, crafting sedition charges against individuals, have contrasted singularly with the pictures of rows of women sitting with children, waving the flag and copies of the Constitution and most of all, dedicated to peaceful protest. The importance of this cannot be underestimated.

Speaking at a panel on the results of the Delhi elections on a television channel, Seshadri Chari, a senior BJP spokesperson, described the communally vituperative campaign of his party as ""not hate politics but strategy"". This is a chilling statement. The problem, however, is not only its questionable morality - an important if not scary issue - but the failure of the strategy.

Clearly, as strategy, it has had its uses. The BJP vote share in the 2020 Delhi elections has been reasonable enough. But it failed to produce a cutting edge precisely because the strategy did not extend beyond the rhetoric of incitement. It was the deliberate commitment to peaceful protest by the women satyagrahis - ordinary mothers, homemakers, youth - that staved off any violent counter-response. Counterfactually speaking, if there had been the slightest hint of violent response, the spiral of violence and communal polarisation would have been uncontrollable. The strategy of hate would then have been unstoppable. It would have upended the politics of ""kaam"".

It may be recalled that the women have carried on despite no acts of solidarity from AAP; instead, they have continuously faced the fear of violent ejection by the police. It is the silent contribution of the Shaheen Bagh women that remains unremarked upon in the high-decibel commentaries on the election results.

It raises a difficult question for the BJP now. It deliberately nationalised the elections. Beginning with the Prime Minister, organised and co-ordinated by the Home Minister and deploying a phalanx of Chief Ministers and over 200 MPs, the BJP campaign has been one of the most communal vituperative ever in the history of India's elections. It has raised questions of national integrity, portraying Shaheen Bagh as a centre of terrorist and anti-national activity - and then going on to associate this unpleasing fiction with AAP. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself has been accused of being a terrorist. The basic elements of this campaign are by no means new. Over time, any opposition to the BJP has been progressively labelled as anti-national. This has provided a momentum of aggression to BJP's nationwide campaigns.

For BJP, Shaheeh Bagh was the testing ground of a new use of communal mobilisation. Within less than a year of its massive general election victory and the apparent success of its strategy of dismembering the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP government has faced the strongest-ever protest that has spread across the entire country on the issue of the CAA-NRC. Most importantly these protests were carried out by the youth of different communities, becoming a platform for voicing dissatisfaction against a governance perceived to be high-handed, regulative of lifestyles and unable to provide jobs.

The Delhi elections provided an opportunity to begin a counter-initiative by the BJP. The BJP-ruled States had put down the protests with an iron hand.

Shaheen Bagh provided an opportunity to initiate an ideological counter-offensive against the protests. Indissociable from the protests against the CAA-NRC which it had given birth to, Shaheen Bagh could be deployed to isolate, marginalise and communalise the protests. The only problem - which finally defeated the BJP strategy - was that it was dominated by women who refused to be provoked.

The unresponsiveness of these women was complemented by the careful distancing of the AAP from the protesters. Both of these put BJP out on a limb. More importantly, it allowed the focus to be put on a positive element, that is, the work done by AAP. If Shaheen Bagh dominated the saffron air waves, it was kaam that was discussed among the ordinary voters on the ground. The laying out of water and sewage pipes, free bus rides to women, the rise of standards in government schools and so on, dominated the agenda. It became so effective that the ground campaigners of the BJP had to take recourse to questioning the wisdom of providing ""freebies"" to the electorate. In short, BJP workers were caught in the self-defeating position of saying that the electorate was unfit for the welfare measures that they have traditionally expected the state to provide.

Where does the BJP go from here? Can it afford to charge with all the vituperation and aggression at its command, like Don Quixote against windmills that refuse to move? For BJP aggressive polarisation has been important for both electoral victory while combining this with establishing the affective and ideological foundations of a future Hindu Rashtra. But if communal polarisation does not work as an issue, what else will the BJP have in its electoral kitty? Delhi has shown that a purely negative campaign of discrediting the agenda of its rivals will not do. Nor can it step back now, for the reputation of its Shah-Modi leadership has been built on its authoritarian stubbornness to defend its positions. There is too much now at stake for the BJP leadership and too little ammunition at its disposal.",,,

The Opposition leaders, led by the Samajwadi Party and the Congress, then staged sit-ins outside the Assembly, holding placards on the issues of law and order, crimes against women, unemployment, rising prices of cooking gas, diesel and petrol and farmer woes, along with the burning subject of CAA, NRC and NPR.
While the SP leaders displayed gas cylinders outside the Assembly, the Congress workers expressed their protest by holding up packets of potato and onion, as well as sugarcane.

The Election Commission on Wednesday ordered the BJP to drop Union minister Anurag Thakur and West Delhi lawmaker Parvesh Verma from its list of star campaigners for Delhi elections after the two politicians were accused of using provocative language.

Verma had alleged that protesters gathered at Shaheen Bagh would enter homes, rape and kill and claimed that this can be prevented if the BJP is elected in the February 8 polls.

Thakur, on the other hand, was sent notice by the poll body for his election speech where he was heard saying to a gathering, ""desh ke gaddaron ko..."" leading to the people to reply in unison ""...goli maro s****n ko"". Thakur was campaigning for the party's Rithala candidate Manish Chaudhary.

The comments were seen in sequence with a string of controversial comments and, rivals allege, communally divisive rhetoric that the BJP has used over the past week in the Delhi election campaign.

Analysts have said the BJP's turn to divisive rhetoric is an attempt to consolidate Hindus in an election where it was widely perceived to start with a disadvantage because of the AAP's contention of providing better governance.

The BJP also does not have a CM face against the incumbent, Arvind Kejriwal, and is fighting the election in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""If you see the video, Thakur did not even say the words. So, in a way, he should not be held responsible. The slogan was not invented by him; it has lasted for years,"" said Khurana.

As the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) Sunday morning shut down the entry and exit of the Jaffrabad station in Northeast Delhi after protesters against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) gathered around the station, BJP leader Kapil Mishra said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was right in calling the Shaheen Bagh protest ""an experiment.""

""Stage is being set up in Jaffrabad. Another area where the law of India will not be followed. Modi ji rightly said that Shaheen Bagh was an experiment. Be ready for road blockage, streets, markets, neighborhoods will also be blocked one by one. Keep quiet till they do not knock on your door,"" Mishra wrote on Twitter attaching a video of a stage being constructed.

Prime Minister Modi, at an election rally in Delhi earlier this month, had said that the protests against CAA in Shaheen Bagh is not a coincidence, but an experiment by the Opposition parties to disturb the peaceful environment in the national capital. Mishra, who was the BJP candidate from Model Town, lost badly in the just concluded Delhi election.

The protest at Jaffrabad caught the police unaware Saturday night when about 500 people, mostly women, gathered there to protest against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and blocked a major road.

On Sunday, Delhi Police deployed additional personnel around the Jaffrabad metro station area as women continued their protest against the CAA. There was already heavy security deployment, including women police personnel, in the area when the protest began Saturday night.

The women, carrying the national tricolour and raising slogans of 'aazadi', said they would not move from the site till the Centre revoked Citizenship (Amendment) Act, PTI had reported. They also tied a blue band on their arm and also raised 'Jai Bhim' slogans.

The women had blocked road No. 66 which connects Seelampur to Maujpur and Yamuna Vihar. Another protest against the CAA is already on near the main Seelampur road and Kardampuri.

The protest at Jaffrabad began even as efforts are on to clear a road blocked by anti-CAA and anti-NRC protesters at Shaheen Bagh in Southeast Delhi for over two months.

The protesters have blocked the road connecting Southeast Delhi and Noida. The Supreme Court has appointed mediators to find a way to end the impasse.

Protesters say the CAA which fast tracks citizenship for illegal non-Muslim migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh is unconstitutional, divisive and discriminatory because it makes religion a test of citizenship.",,,

BJP president J P Nadda on Thursday said by bringing in the Citizenship Amendment Act Narendra Modi had implemented what Mahatma Gandhi and the previous prime ministers merely talked about.

Addressing a rally in Himachal Pradesh's Solan, Nadda called Modi a ""world leader"", citing also the praise he got from US President Donald Trump during his recent India visit.

Nadda claimed that Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Manmohan Singh talked about bringing minorities persecuted in the neighbouring countries to India.

""They merely said so but Modi did so,"" he said.

The population of minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan has reduced drastically, he said, claiming that many of their members have converted.

The new law fast-tracks Indian citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis who left these countries before 2015 due to religious persecution.

Nadda accused opposition parties of misleading people on the amended citizenship law.

Beginning a two-day trip to Himachal Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party leader claimed that Donald Trump praised India and Modi for 20 minutes out of his 28-minute speech at the Motera cricket stadium in Gujarat.

Nadda described Modi as a ""world leader"".

He said the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 will strengthen the region.

""India has become one country constitutionally under Modi's leadership,"" he said.

He referred to the last block development council elections, saying they were held without a single drop of blood being shed.

The BJP president said a delimitation exercise in Jammu and Kashmir would now enable reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha and the Vidhan Sabha for the Gujjar-Bakarwal community.

Accusing other political parties of ""parivarvad"", he said, ""No one can stop the BJP from growing further as it is the only party which is based on ideology. This is the only party which keeps on introspecting."" ""We know who will be next president of the Congress, NCP, SP, BSP, Telugu Desam and YSR Congress. But the BJP is the only party where nobody knows who will be the next chief,"" he said.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has said that the win in Delhi assembly polls is people's verdict against the ""terrorist"" tag given to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

The tweet comes on the day AAP swept the Delhi assembly polls with confirmed wins or leads on about 62 out of the 70-seats in the assembly. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also won his New Delhi seat with over 20,000 votes.

""The family of two crore Delhi residents have declared that their son Arvind Kejriwal is not a terrorist but a patriot. We bow before the great people of Delhi,"" said the tweet.

BJP leader and MP Parvesh Verma was gagged by the election commission for likening Kejriwal to a terrorist during the election campaign.

""If Kejriwal comes to power again, Madipur's streets will become Shaheen Bagh. There are many Natwarlals (cheats) like Kejriwal and 'aatankwadis' (terrorists) like Kejriwal hiding in Delhi. We have to throw them out. I fail to understand if we should fight terrorists in Kashmir or against terrorists like Kejriwal in Delhi,"" Verma had said.

AAP milked Verma's onslaught and launched a counter-campaign alleging the remark was an insult to Delhi's ""son"" and that the people of the capital will give a befitting reply to the BJP for calling him a traitor.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has retained the Patparganj seat by a little over 3,200 votes. A founding member of the AAP, Mr. Sisodia holds the education, finance and tourism portfolios in addition to his post as Deputy CM.

The AAP's Atishi Marlena is leading in Kalkaji constituency. Ms. Marlena was the AAP's candidate against BJP MP Gautam Gambhir in East Delhi during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

Kapil Mishra of the BJP -- who tweeted the controversial comparison of the Delhi elections to a contest between India and Pakistan, and was censured by the ECI -- is trailing against the AAP's Akhilesh Tripathi by over 11,000 votes. Mishra defected to the BJP from the ruling party in 2019 and even campaigned for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.

The Congress' Arvinder Singh Lovely, who also contested unsuccessfully against Mr. Gambhir, is trailing in the Gandhi Nagar constituency. Mr. Lovely, who was a Minister in the Sheila Dikshit government, had jumped ship to the BJP in 2015, only to rejoin the Congress in 2018, calling himself an ""ideological misfit"" in the saffron party.

Former Chandni Chowk MLA Alka Lamba, who rejoined the Congress in 2019, has barely over 3,400 votes, as against the AAP's Parlad Sawhney's 45,800-odd vote count.

Newcomer Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga of the BJP is trailing behind the AAP in Hari Nagar. Mr. Bagga physically assaulted lawyer Prashant Bhushan in 2011, for the latter's remarks supporting a plebiscite in Jammu & Kashmir. He has also been a Delhi BJP spokesperson since 2017, after gaining prominence by running social media campaigns in favour of the party.

In Okhla constituency, where the Shaheen Bagh protests have been taking place, sitting MLA and member of the AAP's national executive Amanatullah Khan is leading by a massive margin of close to 77,000 votes. The constituency also includes Jamia Nagar where protests and violence took place.

Incumbent MLA and former Delhi BJP chief Vijender Gupta is leading in Rohini -- a seat that the BJP has held for over a decade, with only a brief loss to the AAP in 2013. His margin, is a little over 12,600 votes.

One of the AAP's youngest leaders Raghav Chadha, who is contesting from Rajinder Nagar, has won. Mr. Chadha campaigned for the seat by reminding people that he is a ""local boy"" who grew up in the area.

AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj is also leading in Greater Kailash constituency with a margin of over 16,000 votes. The AAP candidate had earlier beaten the BJP's Ajay Kumar Malhotra and Rakesh Guliya in 2013 and 2015, respectively, with huge margins.",,,

She slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that when the entire nation was bothered about the GDP and the economic crisis, Mr Modi has only two agendas: Shaheen Bagh and Pakistan. ""I am proud of the Shaheen Bagh women who have become the face of resistance against the rise of fascism"".

Reiterating her concern that despite repeated condemnation of violence against women, Ms. Karat said that crimes against women were at an all-time high with one rape occurring every 90 minutes in India.

Accusing Home Minister Amit Shah of the alleged misuse of the Delhi police, Ms. Karat said that Mr. Shah and the BJP leaders used all means to win Delhi elections but they failed.

""Though the BJP leaders used the Delhi election rallies to express their hate as a campaign message, the National Commission for Women maintained a silence. Even the Election Commission failed to impose serious action against the BJP leaders for their hate speeches,"" she added.

99,,"The Pulwama suicide car bombing, for which the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group owned responsibility, was the deadliest single attack in 30 years of insurgency in Kashmir.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers who died in the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir a year ago to the day on Friday, as the Congress and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) engaged in a political slugfest.

""Tributes to the brave martyrs who lost their lives in the gruesome Pulwama attack last year. They were exceptional individuals who devoted their lives to serving and protecting our nation. India will never forget their martyrdom,"" Modi wrote in a Twitter post.

The CRPF joined the prime minister in recalling the victims of the attack, in which a man drove an explosives-laden car into a truck carrying the troopers in Pulwama. ""We pay our heartfelt tribute to all the martyrs. CRPF is a brave fighting force on the federal grid and remains undeterred by any untoward incident,"" CRPF director general AP Maheshwari, said.

The Pulwama suicide car bombing, for which the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group owned responsibility, was the deadliest single attack in 30 years of insurgency in Kashmir. It heightened tensions in the subcontinent, and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. On February 26, 2019, the Indian Air Force (IAF) bombed a Jaish terrorist camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan, followed by a dogfight the following day over the Line of Control in Kashmir.

The Congress raised questions about the attack and the inquiry into it, and asked why the report on it was not being made public.It has previously alleged that the BJP had tried to gain political and electoral mileage out of the Balakot strikes by the IAF.

""Today as we remember our 40 CRPF martyrs in the #PulwamaAttack, let us ask: 1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack?"" former Congress president Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the entire nation paid homage to the martyrs of Pulwama; still, many questions remain about the attack.

""Why is the report of Pulwama attack not being made public? Who is accountable? Who brought the 350 Kgs IED? Why were intelligence reports of attack ignored?"" he tweeted. IED is short for improvised explosive device.

The BJP was quick to hit back, with minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy accusing Gandhi of insulting security forces. ""Did surgical strike or airstrike ever take place under the Congress rule? For the first time, Pakistan is afraid of us. Rahul Gandhi has insulted security forces by commenting on them,"" he said.

And, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said Gandhi had chosen to target not just the government but even the security forces at a time when the nation was paying tributes to those killed in the Pulwama attack.

""When nation is paying homage to martyrs of dastardly Pulwama attack, Rahul Gandhi, a known sympathizer of LeT & Jaish-e-Mohammed, chooses to target not just the government but security forces as well. Rahul will never question real culprit, Pakistan. Shame on you Rahul,"" tweeted Narasimha Rao.

Even the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), questioned the government about the inquiry report on the attack and demanded accountability, accusing the BJP of seeking votes in the name of the CRPF personnel killed in the attack. ""Where is the Inquiry report one year on after the terror attack? Who has been held accountable for the loss of so many lives and the massive intelligence failure?"" CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said.

Separately, the CRPF said on Friday that the families of all its personnel who died in Pulwama had been paid dues ranging from ~2-3 crore and were getting the last pay drawn as monthly pension, except one over which a case is pending in the courts because of questions over who the legal heir is.

The victims were honoured on Friday with a memorial at the Lethpora camp of the force, close to the location of last year's attack, in a solemn and emotive ceremony. The memorial is inscribed with the names of all the 40 troopers along with their photographs and the motto of the Central Reserve Police Force -- 'Seva and Nishtha' (Service and Loyalty).

Maharashtra's Umesh Gopinath, who undertook a 61,000 km journey to meet the families of the 40 troopers, collected soil from their homes in an urn and presented it to the CRPF at the ceremony.",,,

But it also signalled that it could not approve a protest that would go on indefinitely at the same location. The bench said the protests could continue but it should be done in an area ""designated for protests"".

""You cannot block a public road indefinitely. If everybody starts protesting everywhere, then what will happen,"" the bench led by Justice Kaul said.

The top court had last week put off hearing two petitions filed against the protests in south Delhi in light of the assembly elections held on February 8. The bench had then indicated that it recognised that there was a problem and intended to examine how to resolve it.

But at the same time, the judges were conscious that it did not want its decision to impact elections in the national capital. ""Why should we influence it?"" the bench had responded last week on a request for a decision before the Delhi election.

Shaheen Bagh has become the epicentre of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which empowers the government to fast-track the grant of Indian citizenship to so-called persecuted minorities from the Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The law has been criticised by many because of its exclusionary nature. It is also feared that it will be used in tandem with a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The government has clarified that there was no decision to implement a nationwide NRC though it has spoken of plans in parliament and outside that the register is imminent.

The petition complains that the road closure at Shaheen Bagh causes great inconvenience to the public and leads to wastage of precious time, energy and fuel besides overburdening the Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway, Akshardham and Ashram routes.

The Kalindi Kunj road, Sahni argued, is a vital route since it connects three states -- Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana -- and the road closure has led to huge difficulties not only for the residents of the area but hundreds of thousands of commuters who are not able to use the road because of the blockade.

Launching a scathing attack on the Congress ahead of the coming gram panchayat elections, State BJP president and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said here on Monday that the grand old party was facing intellectual bankruptcy and it was fomenting violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the country.

Addressing party workers at a function organised to install the new office-bearers of Dakshina Kannada unit of the party, Mr. Kateel said that the Congress had become irrelevant as it had lost the confidence of people in the country.

He said that dynasty politics, craving for power, corruption and compromising with its grand old principles proved too costly for the party that it could not win enough seats to get recognised as an Opposition party during the last year's Lok Sabha election.

Mr. Kateel said that the 135-year-old Congress was being headed by an interim president, Sonia Gandhi, now. The Congress could not get a president appointed to its Karnataka unit. Ever since the era of Jawaharlal Nehru, the Congress is still following dynasty leadership.

""How can a party (Congress) which is facing a leadership crisis both at the national and State levels can lead the country?"" Mr. Kateel asked.

""Political power in the Congress was vested with its Ministers and MLAs. But in the BJP, the power is vested with its party workers,"" he said.

Mr. Kateel said that the BJP would and should continue its party worker-centric approach.

Otherwise, it would have to face the same situation like the Congress was facing now, he added.

The BJP State president said that the Congress was indulging in negative campaigning on the CAA in the country by instigating protesters.

He said that Mahatma Gandhi wanted to give Indian citizenship to minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The Congress leader, late Indira Gandhi, too wanted it. But the Congress of today could not make the aspirations of its own leaders a reality.

He cited an incident of a Congress leader, who raised the slogan in the neighboring country to take a jibe at the ruling party.

Addressing a poll rally in Jangpura, Gandhi said that the Congress candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah, who is contesting the election on the party's ticket went to Pakistan in 1987 and raised the ""Hindustan Zindabad"" (Long live India).

""The BJP leaders talk about patriotism. Show me just one BJP leader who raised 'Hindustan zindabad' slogan in Pakistan. Congress' Jangpura candidate (Tarvinder Singh Marwah) did that and he went to jail for it,"" he said.

He dismissed allegations of a rift in the AIADMK-BJP alliance in the State. The new BJP president for Tamil Nadu will be announced after the Delhi elections, Mr. Rao added.

109,,"Images of bloody communal violence have scarred Delhi. The violence comes barely weeks after a shrill and polarised election campaign in which anti-CAA protesters became the target of incendiary rhetoric by top politicians. When politicians described protesters as ""desh ke gaddar"" (traitors) the message was clear: there would be no reach out, instead, there would be confrontation. When leaders preach violence, they give permission to footsoldiers and street confrontation is precisely what has happened, pitting Hindu against Muslim.

The politics of confrontation is not limited to Delhi. In Bengaluru a young citizen has been slapped with sedition charges simply for chanting a slogan. According to a Crime in India report, sedition cases were slapped 156 times during 2016-18. Since the anti-CAA protests began in December, 194 people have been charged with sedition. When governments repeatedly slap sedition on citizens a chilling warning is sent out.

Politicians have become confused about the meaning of democracy. They equate democracy with an electoral majority. But majoritarianism is not democracy which means, above all, respect for debate and dissent. Today's governing party could be tomorrow's governed, which is why by restraining the coercive power of the state through watchdog institutions, democracy protects the smallest minority - the free individual. Majoritarianism, on the other hand, inevitably leads to an abuse of the state apparatus because majoritarian regimes cannot tolerate anyone not part of the ""majority"" which is in office.

It's intriguing that it's fallen upon the higher judiciary to send emissaries to the public agitation in Shaheen Bagh. The role of such interlocution ordinarily should fall on the government which is best placed to offer solutions. But the Modi government either ignores Shaheen Bagh or demonises it, ruling out dialogue. In fact the Modi government consistently avoids the principal forum for dialogue, namely Parliament, thus grossly devaluing discussion and debate.

The fact that the establishment has not been able to offer any kind of structured interaction for a protest that has been going on for two months, shows the government prefers wielding force over face-to-face interaction. This is dangerous.

When governments refuse to dialogue, the result is a slide into violence on both sides. India's state is already a highly coercive one, and if the threat of state violence is used against protests, this not only normalises violence but also blurs the lines between law and crime on the ground. In the process, moderates are squeezed out and space is created for goons of every stripe to enter the fray. This is evident from the armed ruffians prowling the streets of Delhi, emboldened by governing parties' violent speech.

In Kashmir too, where there should be dialogue, there is instead a deafening void. Three CMs are in detention on questionable grounds. The longest internet shutdown in a democracy is depriving millions of access to services and information. The best the government has been able to do is send some EU representatives for shikhara rides and a group of BJP ministers to meet carefully vetted ""Kashmiri people"". In sharp contrast, former PM Vajpayee (also from BJP) and home minister Advani held several rounds of talks even with the separatist Hurriyat Conference.

The Big State is using strong arm tactics across India. In Bidar, Karnataka, authorities chose to slap sedition cases on parents and teachers because of a junior school play rather than hold talks with school authorities for a resolution of the controversy. When historian Ramachandra Guha was whisked away in a police van it showed that aggressive state power doesn't spare even distinguised scholars.

In Lucknow's ghanta ghar, where a Shaheen Bagh like protest is ongoing, police swooped down in a show of armed might and arrested over 100 women. In Chennai, another anti-CAA protest at Washermanpet locality has been lathicharged and barred from taking out a procession. During Delhi's election campaign the governing BJP sought to muzzle and delegitimise its rivals by calling them ""terrorists"" who speak the language of Pakistan. Using the high perch of state power to cast political rivals as national enemies and terrorists, legitimises violence in society as a whole.

Gandhi warned constantly of the inherent violence of an expanding state. When a government begins to use police power to coerce citizens to its agenda, we have the makings of a police state. The police then becomes a partisan political player, always on the side of governing politicians against the citizen.

Why is dialogue crucial in a healthy democracy? Because peaceful and voluntary exchange of ideas and products lies at the heart not only of a successful society but also of a growing economy. Citizens who want to protect their freedoms and liberties need to be utterly intolerant of violence either by the state or by private actors. By refusing to engage in peaceful exchange with those who are opposing it, governments themselves encourage the cult of violence.

The question may be asked, whether the previous UPA government went too far in attempting to dialogue with its opponents, surrendering executive space. Did the UPA outsource decision-making to NGOs and anti-corruption movements and allow itself to be fatally weakened? The sight of top ministers going to the airport to receive Baba Ramdev at the height of the Anna Hazare agitation was seen as a feeble government meekly capitulating before challengers.

Yet from an enfeebled UPA, we now seem slowly but inexorably moving to the other extreme: an authoritarian state that criminalises dissent and replaces dialogue with the danda. Remember, the Indian police are still governed by an antiquated 19th century law that made them a 'standing army' of the colonial raj. Is that the role we expect them to play in a modern republic?",,,
110,,"MADIKERI/HUBBALLI: A day after Karnataka agriculture minister BC Patil sought a law that enables authorities ""to shoot at sight"" those chanting pro-Pakistan slogans, Madikeri MLA Appachu Ranjan (BJP) echoed his words on Monday. After inaugurating a new building at Somwarpet Government Primary School, Ranjan said: ""Shoot down people who raise pro-Pakistan slogans.""

Amid these developments, fresh trouble brewed elsewhere in the state when the walls of a government higher primary school on the outskirts of Hubballi in Karnataka were on Monday morning found scribbled with 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans. Villagers staged a protest and demanded that the miscreants be promptly arrested.

The statements by the minister and the MLA come in the wake of pro-Pakistan slogans raised by Amulya Leona Noronha, 19, during an anti-CAA event in Bengaluru last week.

Ranjan told the students: ""Every citizen must protect and preserve the nation's rich culture. However, many are involved in anti-national activities. These people are using resources, including food and water, provided by our country and then raising slogans against the nation. Such people must be shot down immediately. They must be exiled and sent to Pakistan. No advocate must fight their cases in court.""",,,
111,,"At least 40 CRPF jawans were killed after the convoy of 78 buses, in which around 2,500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar, came under attack in February last year.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi raised three questioned as he paid tributes to the martyrs of Pulwama attack.

""Today as we remember our 40 CRPF martyrs in the #PulwamaAttack , let us ask: 1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack?"" Gandhi said on Twitter on Friday.

Gandhi had initially expressed solidarity with the government and the security forces after the attack in February last year. ""The entire Opposition stands united with the security forces and the government,"" Gandhi had said in the aftermath of the attack.

But in subsequent months, as Lok Sabha election drew near, he stepped campaign against the prime minister and the BJP-led NDA government's policy to deal with terrorism.

India is marking the first anniversary of the Pulwama attack, the deadliest in decades on security forces in the region, by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) on February 14, 2019.

At least 40 CRPF jawans were killed after the convoy of 78 buses, in which around 2,500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar, in the attack.

Following the dastardly attack, India launched extensive diplomatic efforts to get Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar designated as a global terrorist, which finally became a reality on May 1 last year when China lifted its technical hold on a proposal introduced by the US, the UK, and France in the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council.

Around 12 days after the terror attack, in the wee hours of February 26, Indian Air Force (IAF) jets bombed the JeM camp in Balakot, in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The decision to carry out air strikes was taken within 24 hours of the Pulwama attack, with the government giving the Air Force two weeks to select terror targets and launch air strikes against them, three people familiar with the planning of the mission said, asking not to be named. The Balakot strikes are a classified operation.",,,
112,,"NEW DELHI: The BJP is plagued with a chronic inability to translate its votes into seats in Delhi.

For the sixth consecutive time, BJP's vote share in Delhi assembly elections has hovered in the 30s with 38.51% votes. However, the same consistency was found to be missing in the number of seats won by the saffron party. It could win a mere 8 seats in the 70-seat assembly.

So much so there were 57 constituencies, in comparison to AAP's 34, where BJP received more votes in 2020 than 2015. However, BJP yet again failed to break the jinx of Delhi.

Despite enjoying consistent support in the national capital, the number of seats, won by BJP in the last six assembly polls, have fluctuated from one extreme to another. It won a maximum of 34 seats in 2013 polls and a minimum of 3 seats in 2015.

In 1998 assembly polls, though it secured 34.02% votes, BJP lost to Sheila Dikshit-led Congress party. It seats plummeting to 15 seats from a previous high of 49 seats.

Even at the peak of the popularity of Dikshit government in Delhi, the party was able to keep its vote share intact -- 35.22% (2003) and 36.34% (2008). Once again the BJP failed to translate its vote share into seats and could win 20 (2003) and 23 (2008) seats.

In 2013, in the backdrop of the Modi wave, BJP secured its biggest victory in Delhi by securing 34 seats -- one seat short of the majority. Once again the party received one-third of the total votes polled. Surprisingly, the vote share of 33% was less than the previous election in 2008 when it had secured 36.34% votes.

In 2015, the party suffered its worst defeat. Yet its support base remained intact at 32.3%.

BJP and its consistent support base in Delhi

The reason behind BJP's consistent performance with the voters in Delhi, and not the seats, lies in India's history of partition, according to Biswajit Mohanty associate professor in the department of political science, Deshbandhu College, Delhi.

A city of migrants, Delhi's demography underwent a serious change following the partition when millions of refugees streamed into the city from Pakistan and settled in the dozens of refugee colonies built to rehabilitate them. The refugee families blamed the Congress for their plight and supported Jan Sangh, a party that is believed to have understood the sentiment of the migrant community. Since then the saffron party has occupied a soft soft for the refugees living in these colonies.

Later, the BJP -- to gain the Hindu votes, especially of the erstwhile poor refugees and now prosperous Punjabi Hindus -- aligned actively with the RSS in Delhi. As a result it came to represent the rich class, a section of the educated middle class and upper caste people.

""The urban rich, upper caste and middle class Hindus remained the stable base of the BJP, whose number in Delhi can be roughly estimated between 30 to 40%,"" Mohanty said.

On the other hand, the Congress, termed as the catch-all party, was favoured choice of the poor, lower middle class and Muslims. These groups formed a major portion of the population in Delhi and hence was able to defeat BJP despite it enjoying the support of the urban rich, upper caste and middle class Hindus.

Why BJP can't convert its votes into seats

From its inception, Delhi has been witnessing bi-party politics -- BJP versus Congress till 2013 and then BJP versus AAP from 2015 onwards.

""The BJP could not do better in the most of the earlier elections even in the state elections where the congress would always begin with a 35% advantage with the Muslim and underprivileged support base,"" Mohnaty added.

Since 2013 the role of the Congress has been taken over by the Aam Aadmi Party in the national capital. The ever growing population of the economic migrants in Delhi from other states has also helped AAP to strengthen its base.

""The poor, lower class and upper caste votes had already become the support base of the AAP, a d‚j… vu of the Congress politics in the initial phase of 1990s in Delhi, the addition of the middle class became an added advantage. It is because of AAP's vote share crossed more than 50 per cent with all the sections supporting it, the BJP's vote share could not be converted into the seats across Delhi,"" Mohanty said.",,,
113,,"Aziz Qureshi, former Governor, calls the act the 'mischief of an employee'.

Madhya Pradesh Urdu Academy Chairman Aziz Qureshi said that the removal of portraits of President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi from his office - just the night before he took charge - was intended to stoke a controversy and was the handiwork of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), seeking to derail efforts at course correction at the literary institute.

""It was all a planned conspiracy. It was the mischief of an employee who allegedly removed the portraits for the purpose of cleaning them,"" Mr. Qureshi, former Congressman and Governor, told The Hindu. He denied the charge that the portraits were removed by the employee to mark protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Stating that in the past 15 years, the former BJP government in the State had ""destroyed"" the academy here, he claimed it often pressured employees to march in lockstep. ""They dissolved the working committee and the general body, and used funds for political purposes. This won't be allowed anymore,"" he said.

In March 2016, allegations regarding the academy's 'saffronisation' came to the fore when Urdu poet Manzar Bhopali accused the secretary of it, who then filed a criminal defamation suit in return. He had in the past also written to former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan alleging corruption in the State-run body.

""The academy was a dream of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and I was among the advocates of it. The Chair is an opportunity for me to promote Urdu. It will function purely as a non-political, literary body. Irrespective of ideologies, students with merit can step inside it,"" said Mr. Qureshi, who took charge on January 24.

On the morning of Januray 31, former BJP MLA Surendra Nath Singh led party workers to the Academy, where they raised slogans against the State government, and submitted portraits of Mr. Modi and Mr. Kovind. Mr. Qureshi alleged the workers asked the staff, predominantly Muslim, to go to Pakistan.

Denying the charge, Mr. Singh said, ""It's a government-run institution, and both Mr. Modi and Mr. Kovind hold Constitutional posts. When there are portraits of others, why not have theirs too?""

Though the Election Commission of India has prohibited the display of portraits of the Prime Minister in government offices, it hasn't done so for the President. Still, in 2017, the former BJP government in Madhya Pradesh made it mandatory to display portraits of the Chief Minister along with the Prime Minister in all government offices, an order still in force.

The employee, against whom the police have registered an FIR on complaint from Mr. Qureshi, claimed he was being made a scapegoat to settle the issue. ""The portraits have been there for more than a year, and dusting them before a new official joins is regular practice. When I took down the portraits someone took photographs and circulated them. This is affecting me and my family mentally and socially,"" he said while requesting anonymity.

""I have never taken part in a protest. With a case charged against me now, there's a blot on my life,"" said the employee for 30 years, in response to the allegation that his removal of portraits came as an act of protest against the CAA.

Meanwhile, Deepak Vidrohi, a lawyer, and former student of the academy said the language was wrongly associated with one community -- Muslims -- who became easy targets. ""Any language can't be looked through the prism of religion or community. It is continuously evolving. Language is region-specific and not religion-specific.""",,,
114,,"They demand an end to communal politics, ask Centre to revoke CAA or clear doubts about the law

Eleven days into a sit-in demonstration, on the lines of the protest at Shaheen Bagh, women protesters at Hauz Rani on Monday appealed to political leaders to not politicise the demonstrations ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Delhi.

Demanding that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act be revoked, protesters asked why the right to free speech is reserved only for politicians and not for those seeking constitutional rights.

Zainab Mallick, a homemaker, said: ""From [Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister] Yogi Adityanath to Delhi MPs, everyone seems to be making controversial statements pertaining to Shaheen Bagh and the Muslim community. The ones firing shots are hailed as 'desh bhakts' but we are raising the flag and are being called 'anti-nationals'. What kind of logic is this?"" Stating that the CAA is ""clearly snatching rights from the Muslims"", the 25-year-old, added: ""We are pained with the constant vilification of the Muslims. Why are we being treated like this? Instead of talking about the economy, women's safety and education, all that is being talked about is Pakistan. Why should we go there? Jinko jaana tha wo chalein gaye [The ones who had to go are already gone].""

The protest at Gandhi Park saw a stream of visitors, with women taking turns to occupy a tent accompanied by their toddlers.

Samreen, (23), also a homemaker, said: ""Stop playing politics in our name. If you [Centre] say that there are rumours about the CAA then why don't you come and clear our doubts? We brought you to power and now just because we are questioning you, we are being called 'anti-nationals'. If the police are with the Centre then where will we get the bullets from? What narrative are you trying to spread and why should we even support this law?""

With a toddler in tow, Ms. Samreen added: ""Education and economy in the country is in a bad shape. Instead of talking about real issues why spew hate? Yahan pe kaam chalega jumla nahi [Work matters here and not gimmicks].""

Taira, (60), who is a regular at the demonstration, said: ""We are here for our demands not for anything related to the elections. While some are dragging Arvind Kejriwal into the issue, others are talking about the BJP. All we want is our rights.""

Adding that the protesters are trying to ""speak to the Centre and not the Delhi government"", Ms. Mallick added, ""Our concern is with the ones who brought in this law in the first place. So it does not matter whether Mr. Kejriwal is supporting us or not. We want the Centre to hear us. It is high time that politics over the Hindu-Muslim dichotomy ends.""",,,
115,,"Bengaluru: Actor Naseeruddin Shah late Friday evening made a surprise appearance at Bilal Bagh, Bengaluru's Shaheen Bagh where women are on indefinite dharna against Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. He said women protesting in similar spaces across the country have given him the courage to speak up about all that's wrong with the country.

Thousands of women thronged the shamiyana at the protest venue to catch a glimpse of Shah, who arrived around 9pm. They applauded his remarks attacking critics of the anti-CAA protest.

""These brave women are being asked by some that how can they come out on the streets. Have the men sent them to protest? Who gave them permission? And to them, I have only one thing to say: These brave women are awakened now and don't need anyone's approval,"" Shah said to the roaring applause from the all-woman gathering.

""When students in Jamia Millia Islamia are attacked, when a nine-year-old girl in Bidar is traumatised and is forced to live alone because her mother is taken into custody on no grounds and when in Delhi's Gargi College, miscreants enter the premises and misbehave with our daughters, people who have spoken about 'beti-padao beti-bachao' seem to have still not found a voice to speak out,"" Shah said, adding the incidents left his blood boiling.

""But women like you in Shaheen Bagh and Bilal Bagh help me find courage and peace of mind,"" he said. Shah stayed at the venue for around 15 minutes and organisers had a tough time escorting him out due to the huge crowd.

Earlier in the day, independent Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani assured the protesters that he would take their message of peace and resistance to Delhi's Shaheen Bagh and everywhere else where similar protests are under way.

""...I bring you the message of the sisters protesting at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh and Patna's Sabzi Bagh that 'we all are determined, you too remain firm in your resistance and we promise victory will be ours',"" Mevani told the women whose protest entered the seventh day on Friday.

Mevani said whenever someone asks him why protests like Shaheen Bagh are cropping up everywhere in the country and why do so many people go there, he answers: ""Whoever has a conscience will go to Shaheen Bagh, Bilal Bagh and the likes. Those who place their belief in Manusmriti will build detention centres and those who place it in the Constitution will come to Shaheen Bagh.""

""I know you are full of enthusiasm but do remember to keep the slogans of Jai Shri Ram' and 'Nare Taqbeer' in your hearts and homes. Because this is not a Hindu vs Muslim or India vs Pakistan fight. It's BJP vs the entire India,"" he said.",,,
116,,"New Delhi: ""Kaam to kiya hai"". That's the refrain about AAP this correspondent kept hearing on a daylong whistle-stop tour across swathes of south Delhi from Govindpuri to the Cantonment. The tone varies -- those openly declaring that they'll vote for 'jhaadu' say it with pride, while for self-declared BJP and Congress supporters, it is a grudging acknowledgement. 

Judging by this sample of a few dozen people in one part of the capital, Arvind Kejriwal's strategy of making what his government has delivered the sole plank of the election campaign appears to be paying off. In contrast, BJP's high-decibel pitch on Shaheen Bagh, CAA, the 'tukde tukde gang' and so on may not quite be yielding electoral dividends. Most people felt the anti-CAA protests were wrong, but said this had little to do with Delhi polls. 

Many of those spoken to also made it clear that they had voted for Modi (it's the PM whose name is mentioned, not his party's) in 2019 and would do so again in the Lok Sabha polls, but were just as clear that Kejriwal was their choice for running Delhi. Congress as a party is seen by most as not even in the contest, though individual candidates do seem to be in the fray in specific constituencies. 

So what is this ""kaam"" that keeps coming up in discussions? Some elements are predictable -- electricity and water bills being reduced or eliminated, or bus rides being made free for women, for instance. But, as more than one person pointed out, these are concrete, measurable gains. The amounts varied depending on which economic strata one spoke to. Some said they were saving from Rs 1,500 to 2,000 a month from the subsidies and freebies, others even as much as Rs 4,500. 

But at least as important as these quantifiable gains is the perception of government schools being improved. A group of elders in Hauz Rani, both Muslims and Hindus, waxed eloquent about the local school. Some of them had their children studying in private schools. If the improvements continued, they said, they would consider shifting their kids to the neighbourhood government school. 

Health is another area where the government is seen as having made a difference -- and not necessarily through mohalla clinics. Vicky, a fruit seller in Malviya Nagar who makes it clear he will vote for BJP, nods in acknowledgement as a tender coconut seller beside him holds forth on how the government hospital in the locality has been beefed up. Medicines, once hard to come by at the hospital, are now more often than not available, he admits. And, if the hospital is unable to treat you, the doctors put that down in writing and the government foots the bill for your treatment even in corporate hospitals, he adds in amazement. Whether or not this actually works quite so smoothly, the perception is telling. 

Roads, sewage lines and hand pumps being installed also figure in this discourse on 'kaam'. The perception that AAP MLAs are accessible and you can get to them without going through middlemen doesn't hurt either, though this could be specific to the constituencies visited. 

The young are particularly focused on ""development"". ""Unemployment is the main issue for us. You have lived the best of your life, but ours still lies ahead,"" says Nadeem, who seems in his early 20s. Without jobs, the best and most educated of our generation are forced to do ghulami (slavery) in foreign countries. This is what we need to fix instead of wasting time on frivolous issues."" 

Parampreet Singh, who runs a furnishings shop in Kalkaji, has a similar take: ""Look around the world. Have any of the developed countries got where they have by obsessing about religion? On the other hand, look at places like Pakistan or Afghanistan. Do we want to become like them?""",,,

The college student, identified as Amulya Leona, has been charged with sedition, provoking enmity between groups, and intentional insult to provoke breach of peace, said Deputy Commissioner of Police Ramesh Bannoth.

It was just after Mr. Owaisi's arrival on the stage at Freedom Park here that the 19-year-old student was asked to speak. After preliminary remarks, she suddenly shouted ""Pakistan zindabad"" thrice, leaving the crowd and organisers stunned.

Some of the organisers rushed to her and tried to take the mike away and stop her from speaking further. Mr. Owaisi too joined in. Holding on to the mike, the girl then went on to shout ""Hindustan zindabad"" twice, before a posse of police personnel and organisers whisked her away from the stage.

Soon after the student was taken away, a visibly upset Mr. Owaisi told the crowd: ""Whatever has been spoken [by the girl] is wrong. Neither my party nor I has any connection with it. As long as we are alive, we will be raising Bharat zindabad slogans. Never had we any relationship with Pakistan nor will we have anything in future,"" he announced.

He further stated: ""This is condemnable. The organisers should not have invited such people to this place. If I had known that these kind of things would be said here, I would not have come here.""

It is unfortunate that the organisers have invited such people and a wrong message is going out, he said.

""Now, BJP has got an opportunity and will blame me,"" he added.

Every speaker, who took the podium after the incident, condemned the pro-Pakistan slogans raised by Amulya.

Janata Dal (S) councillor representing Gurappanapalya, Imran Pasha, one of the organisers of the protest under ""Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isayi Federation"", claimed that they had not invited the ""activist"" and were not aware that she would be speaking from the stage. Mr. Pasha said that such statements were ""a deliberate attempt to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims"".

Meanwhile, the BJP State unit tweeted, ""Truth is that protests against CAA are a joint venture between Pakistan and anti-National forces led by INC India.""

The Foreign Service Institute, a renowned institution where diplomats are trained, has also been renamed as Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service.

The government's decision to name the two institutions after Sushma Swaraj came a day before her 68th birth anniversary.

The illustrious leader who brought rare empathy and a human approach to India's diplomacy as External Affairs Minister in the previous Narendra Modi government died on August 6 last year following a massive cardiac arrest.

The Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, said the two institutions have been renamed in solemn tribute to the ""invaluable contribution"" of Sushma Swaraj to Indian diplomacy, the cause of the Indian diaspora and the ethos of public service.

""The announcement is being made on the eve of her birth anniversary falling on February 14 in honour of the legacy and decades of public service of the former External Affairs Minister,"" it said.

As External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj brought a sense of assertiveness in India's diplomacy besides engaging the diaspora, a central focus of the country's foreign policy priorities.

She was one of the most followed foreign ministers on Twitter globally. She was known for helping Indians stuck abroad as she was quick to respond to their calls for help on Twitter. She even became popular in Pakistan for her response to people wanting to get visas for medical treatment in India.

But we need to be in power in the state to make it a reality. In Delhi, people living in jhuggis will get two-room flats built under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. There will be paved roads, streetlights, proper drainage, gardens and libraries. But for that we need a BJP government in Delhi.""

""We will give scooters to poor college-going girls, bicycles to primary and secondary school girl students and flour to poor at Rs 1 per kg up to 5kg per person. We don't make false promises. We say it and we do it. Our government is going to form in Delhi and I assure you that both the central and state governments are going to make Delhi the best capital in the world,"" the home minister said.

Shah also addressed meetings at Sadar Bazar, Rajendra Nagar and Chirag Dilli and attended a roadshow at Karol Bagh. At Sadar Bazar, he assured that CAA was not meant to take anyone's citizenship.

""These people (Congress and AAP) instigated our Muslim brothers and sisters that your citizenship will go away. I have said this many times. Citizenship will be given to refugees under CAA, not taken away from anyone. These people (refugees) have as much right here as you or me. You tell me whether we should give them citizenship or not,"" Shah said, stressing on the fact that in Delhi, one-third of the people are refugees from Pakistan.

Attacking the AAP government, Shah said all development claims by them were lies.",,,
121,,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Tuesday slammed the Congress over ex-Mumbai police commissioner Rakesh Maria's claim that Lashkar-e-Taiba planned to project the 26/11 terror attack as a case of Hindu terror, saying it raised questions whether the ""saffron terror plot was the combined project of the Congress and Pakistan's ISI"".

In his memoir 'Let Me Say It Now' released on Monday, Maria who helmed the investigation in 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, claimed that the LeT had planned to project the attack as a case of ""Hindu terror"" and Pakistani terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Kasab was to die as Bengaluru's Samir Chaudhari.

Taking on the Congress over the claim, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said that for the first time in the history of Islamic terrorism the perpetrators have attempted to mislead people about their identity.

""This raises serious questions, if the saffron terror plot was the combined project of the Congress and Pakistan's spy agency ISI. Around the same time, the UPA coined the saffron terror tag and Rahul Gandhi told US diplomats that India's homegrown groups are a greater threat to the country then Islamic terror groups,"" he said.

Rao alleged that Rahul Gandhi's comments seemed to have joint sponsorship of terror groups across the Line of Control and added that Kasab's fake ID proof and fake claims of the Congress not just have a coincidental resonance but also seem to be part of a larger conspiracy.

He demanded answers from the Congress, saying the party should come clean on this and should clarify whether ISI was also extended part of the Congress-led UPA.",,,

The ruling party's retort came almost immediately after Gandhi, while paying homage to the 40 slain CRPF personnel killed in the attack, asked who benefitted the most from the attack and what was the outcome of the inquiry into it.

""Today as we remember our 40 CRPF martyrs in the Pulwama attack, let us ask: 1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack? (sic)"" he asked in a tweet.

BJP spokespersons slammed Gandhi for his remark, alleging that it insulted those killed in the attack.

""When nation is paying homage to martyrs of dastardly Pulwama attack, @RahulGandhi, a known sympathizer of LeT & Jaish-e-Mohammad, chooses to target not just the government but security forces as well. Rahul will never question real culprit, Pakistan. Shame on you Rahul!,"" tweeted BJP spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao.

Shahnawaz Hussain tweeted, ""This is an insult to martyrs who sacrificed their life for the country. Congress has done this in past as well and people taught them a lesson for this blunder. Rahul Gandhi's such remarks help Pakistan counter India on international platforms.""

BJP's outspoken Bairia MLA Surendra Singh has described the ongoing anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi as a global conspiracy by Muslim countries to ""divide the country"".

The Shaheen Bagh protest against the CAA and proposed NRC is a conspiracy sponsored by Muslim countries at the global level, Mr. Singh told reporters here on Friday night.

""This dharna is being staged to divide the country,"" he added.

Prone to making controversial statements, he also attacked All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaddudin Owaisi and described him as an ""enemy of the country"".

""The internal feelings of Owaisi are against India. In reality, Owaisi is the enemy of the country. Though he resides here, his feelings and beliefs are pro-Pakistan,"" said Mr. Singh.

""If his DNA test is conducted, it will be proved that like Jinnah, he wants to make India a Muslim country,"" said Singh.

124,,"In the first state elections of the new decade, whose outcome will be known on Tuesday, incumbent chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in the face of a strong challenge mounted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

After being witness to a fierce election campaign, nearly 14.79 million registered voters in Delhi will finally get an opportunity to vote on Saturday to choose representatives to 70 assembly segments across the national capital and decide who governs the city-state for the next five years.

In the first state elections of the new decade, whose outcome will be known on Tuesday, incumbent chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in the face of a strong challenge mounted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has sought votes in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The first is the AAP's attempt to replicate its success of the 2015 assembly election -- when it won 67 of the 70 seats -- versus the BJP's effort to replicate its success in the 2019 Lok Sabha election,when it won all seven parliamentary seats in Delhi. The second is the AAP's campaign, which is focused on local governance issues and its track record in the past five years versus the BJP's, which focused on the larger ideological issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, national security, and an effort to project all protesters -- and the AAP -- as ""anti-national"". The third is an effort by the AAP to carve out a multi-religious and multi-class alliance versus the BJP's campaign to consolidate Hindu voters across regions, castes and classes. And the fourth is the question of leadership -- where the CM is not pitted against a local rival but the PM.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said the primary issue in the election will be the work done by his government, but hit out at the rival BJP for trying to change the discourse and make it ""about a Hindu vs Muslim"" issue. ""Ours is the first government in 70 years that is seeking votes entirely on the ground of work done on the development front,"" he told HT in an interview on Wednesday. People have to decide whether they ""opt for the politics of abuse and violence, or politics of development"", he added.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said his party's agenda was development. ""We are talking about Ayushman Bharat for free medical care and PM Awas Yojana to provide housing to people... Non-implementation of these two schemes will be the main reason for AAP's defeat in Delhi,"" Tiwari told HT on Wednesday, adding that party did not endorse the provocative statements of some of its MPs.

Over the last four years, the city has voted distinctly for distinct elections.

During the 2015 elections, the AAP bagged 54% of the vote share in the polls. But its vote share decreased in the next two elections held in the city -- the municipal elections in 2017 and the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. The AAP polled the highest share of votes in 2015; it stood second in the 2017 civic elections, with 26% of the votes, and finished third in five of the seven seats in the 2019 national elections, dropping to 18% of the votes and winning no seat.

On the contrary, both the BJP and the Congress improved in terms of vote share in this period. The BJP polled 56% votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, up from 36% in 2017 and 32% in 2015. In 2019, it had a lead in 65 of the 70 assembly constituencies. The Congress got just 10% of votes in 2015, 21% in 2017 and 23% in 2019.

Political observers believe that this election will significantly depend on whether voting patterns of the Lok Sabha election hold, or whether it reverts to the assembly pattern. A Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)-Lokniti poll conducted during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls showed that only about half of the people who voted for the BJP or the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls would have voted for the same party in case of a snap assembly election. The corresponding figure was 82% for the AAP.

The second variable is the impact of the campaign on the polls.

The AAP -- through government advertisements before the model code of conduct, public interaction programmes, townhall meetings by Kejriwal, hundreds of small corner meetings in Delhi neighbourhoods, dozens of rallies and roadshows, and a strong social media campaign -- has advertised its governance record.

In particular, it has focused on the improvement in government schools, public health systems, provision of electricity and water supply and subsidised rates, and free public transport for women. It has also promised to focus on pollution, provision of clean water and cleanliness in its next term if elected to power.

At the end of last year, the BJP had two key campaign planks. Through a parliamentary legislation, and then an announcement by PM Modi at a rally in Delhi, the party claimed credit for providing ownership documents to four million residents of unauthorised colonies in Delhi.

It also promised ""triple-engine governance"" under Modi, for the BJP would then hold the reins of power at the central, state and local level if elected to power.

But the party's campaign took a turn in the wake of protests against the CAA, particularly in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh area. Led by home minister Amit Shah, the party deployed its Cabinet ministers, MPs, former and current chief ministers, and the cadre of ideological affiliates of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to project the protests as ""anti-national"" in character and which suited Pakistan. It blamed the AAP and the Congress for backing these protests, spreading anarchy and violence, and causing inconvenience to the city's residents.

Commenting on the nature of the campaign, Shakti Sinha,a former bureaucrat who has served in the Delhi government and former director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, said: ""AAP's subsidy policy has huge long-term development costs in terms of forgone investment in infrastructure and sustainability, but has created a huge constituency of beneficiaries. Will the BJP be able to sell its message of nationalism and empowerment? It has stemmed the tide that was flowing against it but would it be enough to bring it to power?""

The third related strand was mobilisation of different segments. The AAP hopes to win the substantial support of the city's Muslim population -- which is influential in close to 10 seats. While the minorities had shifted in large numbers to the Congress in the Lok Sabha election, reports indicate they may consolidate behind AAP for they see it as the party best positioned to defeat the BJP. The AAP also hopes to win the support of the Hindu poor and the lower middle-class, primarily on the ground of having delivered tangible benefits to these segments through its welfare schemes. AAP has also sought to quell the impression, pushed by BJP, that it is against Hindu interests, with Kejriwal reciting the Hanuman Chalisa, going to the Hanuman temple on Friday, and candidates repeatedly emphasising their religious identity -- besides focusing on how the party has promised lessons in patriotism in school curricula and supporting moves such as the nullification of Article 370 that gave Jammu and Kashmir special status.

The BJP, for its part, is hoping to consolidate Hindus -- across different demographic segments, from Punjabis, Banias, Purvanchalis (migrants from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar), and Dalits. This is based on the premise that the largely Muslim-driven protests against CAA would antagonise the majority community.

It is here that the performance of the Congress will also play a role, for if it retains its base of Muslims and the poor, weaning them away from AAP, especially in constituencies where it has put up locally strong candidates, it may benefit the BJP.

""Ultimately, it may boil to how much vote the Congress attracts; the higher it is, the more AAP would suffer,"" Sinha said.

And the final strand is leadership. While AAP's mascot is Kejriwal, the BJP is primarily focusing on Modi as the face of the campaign. While the PM addressed only two rallies, it is his image that adorns the party's hoardings and advertisements. Just as in 2019, when the BJP asked who the opposition had to counter Modi, Kejriwal in 2020 is asking who the BJP has to counter him as the CM.

""Arvind Kejriwal is the pole along which these elections are being fought. The AAP is fighting on Kejriwal's charisma and his governance,"" said Neelanjan Sircar, who is affiliated with Ashoka University and the Centre for Policy Research. ""The BJP has ceded the governance narrative to the AAP, but is trying to paint Kejriwal as inimical to Hindu interests. And the Congress is a shadow of its former self.""

It remains to be seen if the BJP had polarised the electorate enough to pull off a win in Delhi, he added. ""Otherwise, it's advantage AAP.""",,,
125,,"Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column 'Roktok' in Sena mouthpiece Saamana, said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is only focused on creating a divide between Hindus and Muslims.

Raut said that while Modi is talking about winning a war with Pakistan in 8-10 days, Shah is looking at taking on the Muslims of the country.

The Sena leader also backed Delhi chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal in the upcoming polls as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader has carried out the work that people wanted. The Delhi election is scheduled for February 8.

In his column, Raut said the armed forces are suffering due to financial crisis and economic slowdown in the country.

""The soldiers of the border forces are not getting their allowance and the unemployed are not getting jobs in the country... If we leave aside Pakistan, the rupee has slid considerably. These are not good signs for the economy. The government should focus more on issues such as inflation, unemployment, and depreciating rupee-value. But the entire attention and force of the BJP?is on dividing the Hindus and Muslims of the country,"" Raut wrote. He added, ""Prime Minister Modi is giving speeches on war with Pakistan, while home minister Amit Shah is looking to fight the Muslims of the country.""

Last week, Modi at the NCC Cadet rally in Delhi had said, ""Pakistan has already lost three wars [with India]. Our armed forces will not take more than 8-10 days to make Pakistan bite the dust.""

""Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an expert in giving speeches. The PM makes speeches but things are not seen in action,"" the column read. The Sena leader added that the PM forgot the fact that soldiers at borders are not being provided with sufficient ration. ""During his NCC cadet speech, PM Modi gave an ultimatum to the Pakistan army. But his ideology in politics is not moving ahead of Pakistan. There are enemies at China border as well who are more dangerous than the Pakistan army. China has taken over Nepal and we are still stuck on Pakistan,"" he said.

Backing Kejriwal's AAP, Raut said that despite several attempts by the Centre, the Delhi CM has done good work. The Sena leader said that the level of campaigning for Delhi polls has slid like the value of the Indian rupee. ""The campaigning for Delhi has reached its peak, and BJP's 65 ministers and 200 MPs are talking about Pakistan and Muslims. Even then Arvind Kejriwal will win... An entire army of the BJP is campaigning; despite this, if BJP loses then it will be the loss of PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah. They lost Maharashtra and Jharkhand, now Delhi, too, will go,"" the column read.",,,
126,,"Uttar Pradesh CM said his Delhi counterpart supported 'divisive forces'.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said Pakistan and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had felt pain when the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was withdrawn.

Mr. Adityanath said the Shaheen Bagh protest was a ""malicious attempt to disturb peace and normal life"" in the national capital.

Addressing a rally at Badarpur here, he said that in the Delhi election, on one side there was the leadership of Narendra Modi for development and nationalism, and on the other, there was the Congress and Mr. Kejriwal who ""support divisive forces"".

""The BJP is working with zero tolerance towards terrorism. But Kejriwal is busy sponsoring and offering biryani in Shaheen Bagh,"" he said.

The U.P. Chief Minister appealed to the people in Badarpur constituency to vote for the BJP, saying that the whole country and the world were watching them as to whom they support in the Delhi election.

Questioning the motive of the protesters at Shaheen Bagh, Mr. Adityanath alleged it was a ""pretext to oppose abrogation of Article 370, court's judgement on Ram temple and Triple Talaq ban.""

""The Shaheen Bagh protest is a pretext. They had to protest against the removal of Article 370 and construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. We can understand their problem. Their problem is ban on Triple Talaq.""

The protest at Shaheen Bagh in southeast Delhi, participated by large number of women, is going on since mid-December against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday asked the Election Commission to ban Mr. Adityanath from campaigning in the national capital over his alleged provocative speeches and also sought his arrest.

Mr. Adiyanath also slamemd the Kejriwal government for ""obstructing"" various government schemes in Delhi.

He said the BJP will implement these schemes including Kisan Samman Nidhi and Ayushman Bharat health scheme after forming the government in Delhi.

Asserting that he ensured peaceful Kanwar Yatras in Delhi, Mr. Adityanath said he has warned that those trying to ""attack"" these religious processions will have to face police bullets.

""I gave directions to make proper arrangements to welcome Lord shiva's devotees. People said riots will take place, but I said if anyone attacks Kanwar Yatras, then police bullets, and not merely words, will put sense into them.""

Ravi on Wednesday said that ""anti-nationals should get bullet and not biryani"", tweeting in support of Union Minister Anurag Thakur who has courted controversy by asking the crowds at a Delhi rally to raise ""shoot the traitor"" slogans against anti-CAA agitators.

Mr. Ravi tweeted, ""Those attacking Union MoS @ianuragthakur for His statement against Traitors are the ones who- Opposed death to Terrorists Ajmal Kasab & Yakub Memon, Supported Tukde Tukde Gang, Spread lies against #CAA.Anti-Nationals should get Bullet not Biryani. #IStandWithAnuragThakur.""

Mr. Ravi's comment on anti-CAA agitators is not an isolated case. Over the last month, the protesters have seen a barrage of similar responses by the BJP leaders in Karnataka.

In early January, BJP MLA Somashekar Reddy had said at a pro-CAA rally that those opposing the law should think of the ""consequences"" if the majority community hits the streets against them. A case has been booked against him in Ballari in this connection.

More recently, Chief Minister's political adviser MP Renukacharya, also at a pro-CAA rally, said that Muslims were collecting weapons in mosques instead of praying, kicking off a row. He refused to apologise for his comments and said that he would not extend any special packages to the community. Revenue Minister R. Ashok too had argued that ""anyone indulging in anti-national activities"" should be shot dead.

Opposition leaders in Karnataka who have spoken in support of anti-CAA protesters have also been on the receiving end. Health Minister B. Sriramulu recently chastised former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy for his ""fondness for Pakistan"" and said that he should settle in the neighbouring country. Mr. Kumaraswamy has been trolled extensively for his criticism of police action against anti-CAA demonstrators in Mangaluru, which left two people dead.

Following the spate of such comments, State BJP President Nalin Kumar Kateel had advised ministers and MLAs of the party to focus on work and refrain from indulging in controversial comments.",,,

""Yesterday (Thursday) when Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke in the Lok Sabha on the CAA and NPR, he said the opposition parties are lying. It is the Prime Minister who spoke lies,"" he told presspersons.

In 2003, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister and Advani was the Home Minister, the Citizenship Act was amended and based on it rules were framed for NPR.

It was implemented only in 2010 for various reasons. It is not that the Congress or the UPA government introduced it and are objecting to it now.

Further, there is no relationship between the NPR and implementation of welfare schemes for the citizens.

The NPR rules were framed based on CAA. But, the Prime Minister tried to create an impression that implementation of the schemes will be affected if the NPR is not updated. The CPI (M) and the opposition parties are urging the citizens not to answer the questions when NPR is updated as if they do not give clear answers even for a few questions, they may be put in detention camps, he said.
