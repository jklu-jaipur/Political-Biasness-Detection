180,,"The Union government is all set to roll out the Goods and Services Tax (GST) that will subsume 16 different taxes, including excise, service tax and VAT from July 1, 2017. Dubbed the biggest taxation reform since Independence, it will be officially launched by President Pranab Mukherjee on June 30, 2017 midnight at the Central Hall of Parliament. Vice President Hamid Ansari, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda are among the top dignitaries attending the event. Two short films on GST will be screened on the occasion. The Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the DMK and the Left parties are boycotting the launch, while the Samajwadi Party is yet to decide. The JD(U), which broke ranks with the Opposition on the President?s election, has decided to register its presence by sending the Bihar Energy Minister to the event. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will not attend and JD(U) MPs are free to attend or keep away. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) broke ranks with the Opposition and is attending the function as ?it had supported the legislation during its passage?. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar will be present at the launch. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has urged the Congress and Left parties not to ?disassociate? from the decision they were a party to. The Samajwadi Party is unsure about attending the function. ?Whether we attend the midnight GST launch or not will be known later in the day,? said senior SP leader Naresh Agarwal. Mr. Agarwal on June 29, 2017 termed the GST a ?black law? that was ?similar to reestablishment of the East India Company in the country?. His colleague, senior leader Rajendra Chaudhary, however, said the SP was always in favour of the tax reform. Justifying the NCP's divergent position from that of most Opposition parties, senior party leader Tariq Anwar said his party had supported legislation during its passage and there was no reason for it to skip the function.",,,
181,,"On Saturday, as the capital got its first taste of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), traders expressed hope for the road ahead, but also expressed some doubts on how to implement the new system. Founded on the concept of ?one nation, one market, one tax?, the Centre has maintained that the GST will be beneficial to consumers by bringing down prices, curbing inflation and, ultimately, reducing delays in tax payments. At Chandni Chowk, Sanjay Bhargava, the general secretary of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, maintained ? like most others ? that the GST was a positive step. But he added, ?I work in the textile sector where procurement of fabric has not been taxable until now. Earlier, special excise duty was charged on textile but only on dispatching of fabric by manufacturers. Moreover, most dealings are done manually, and people don?t have access to computers. They don?t know how GST needs to be implemented. This could create problems in compliance.? At Sadar Bazar, the largest wholesale market in the capital, there were a few first-day hiccups. Some traders said they were still waiting for their GST identification number, while others ? who have never used a computer ? said they were grappling with the new software. ?I am not quite sure how this software works. I have never used a computer before because I would use books to keep records. I am 67 now; it?s tough for me to learn all of this,? said Somesh Jain of Jain Traders, which deals in wholesale plastic work. Some chemists in Delhi expressed uncertainty about the impact it would have on business. ?We have decided to first finish what we have left and have stopped billing for the time being. We have not called for fresh stock right now,? said a chemist at Batra Medicos in Saket. Many restaurants and bars shut early on Friday, while others said they introduced the new rules after midnight. Take, for instance, Hard Rock Cafe, which remains open till 1 am. ?New rules and rates were applied from today morning. For customers who were there post 12 am, we took the decision to clear their bills before midnight. So, we let them sit till after midnight, but they were charged the old rates before GST was to come into effect. We think our revenue will increase because more people will come since taxes have reduced,? said Suresh Kumar, manager of the Saket Branch. Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Manish Sisodia has expressed some apprehensions over the ?hurry? in implementation of GST. A government official maintained, ?Prices, we feel, might go up in many cases and that is not what was envisioned. We hope the confusion clears in the coming days, and we are doing all we can for it.?",,,
182,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday dubbed the overall of India?s tax system through a unified goods and services tax (GST )as a ?good and simple tax? which will end the harassment of traders and small businesses while integrating India into one market with one tax rate. At a midnight event to launch the Goods and Services Tax (GST) at the historic central hall of Parliament, Modi said the indirect tax reform is a result of combined efforts of various political parties at different points of time. ?Today, the GST council met for the 18th time. It is significant that the Gita has 18 parts. As far as something seems, as impossible it seems to achieve, it can be obtained through hard work,? Modi said, quoting Chanakya. GST, he said, is an example of cooperative federalism as the Centre and states together thrashed out a new law with consensus. Besides being a transparent and fair system that will end generation of black money and corruption, GST will promote new governance culture that will end harassment at the hand of tax officials, the prime minister said in his speech. Touching upon initial teething troubles that may be witnessed as six crore small businesses switch over to an online return filing system, the Prime Minister compared the GST rollout to the process of wearing corrective spectacles. ?Yes, there are some who are not comfortable with technology. Even if you go to a trusted eye doctor, if your eye power changes, then you still have to adjust for a few days. This (GST) is like that. GST is such a catalyst that will end the imbalance in India?s development. GST, much like our railway, will be run by the centre and the states. For the first time, centre and state officials will work together: Mr. Modi says. Modi also said that GST would eliminate the compounding effects of multi-layered tax system. ?Tonight, at midnight, we will together move the nation forward. In a little while, the country will move in a new direction. 125 crore people will benefit from this. I don?t agree that GST benefits are limited to just the economy. This path we have chosen is not one party or one governments. It is the result of our combined efforts. We have come together tonight at the central hall of parliament,?  Modi said. The Congress termed the midnight launch, which was attended by President Pranab Mukherjee, Vice-President Hamid Ansari, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and former prime minister H D Deva Gowda besides various Bollywood stars and industrialists, as ?tamasha?, saying it was being rushed in a ?half-baked? manner as a ?self- promotional spectacle?. In his speech, President Pranab Mukherjee pointed out that the GST launch was a journey that began in 2002. ?This historic moment is the culmination of a 14-year journey that began in 2002. The introduction of GST is a momentous event for the country and moment of personal satisfaction for me. As part of the empowered committee, I had the opportunity to meet the chief ministers of Gujarat and Maharashtra, among others. I remained confident that GST was only a matter of time. This was justified when on 8 November 2016, I had the opportunity to give assent to the GST legislation. It has pleasantly surprised everybody by completing its task on time,? the President said. The government promises that the transition to a single, nationwide tax on goods and services will streamline business and boost the economy by tearing down barriers between 31 states and union territories. It is estimated to add 0.4% to 2%to GDP growth. But some businesses are still figuring out how it will work as they race against time to adopt or upgrade cash registers and computer systems, so they are able to file monthly tax returns to comply with the new regime.",,,
183,,"On any routine day, it could have been a fine routine lunch and chit-chat time at little over 2 PM at the Income Tax building on Main Road in the city. But implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in another 10 hours is what has kept all the staff of newly bifurcated GST wing in the building on their toes. Everyone is visibly busy setting up systems to files to anything and everything from here to there, so that a working system could be developed or at least on the day GST is launched. Apparently, it?s not only traders on roads and in their shops who claim not to be ready for new tax regime on their part, but even government officials appear to be as busy if not less as any bank employee on November 10 last year, the day when bank branches opened for the first time after demonetization. ?The situation is almost the same here. You can see everyone busy doing at least one thing or the other, and we have been working tirelessly here in the building since some time. We want to leave no stone unturned from our part of preparedness, as there are people on the other side of the road already accusingly claiming that even government officials are not ready,? said an official who has been recently transferred to GST wing. It is true that carrying views of friends and follies on both side of shoulders, the government is ready to hammer the bell of GST in existence at Parliament House at sharp 12 Midnight of June 30-July 1. ?At the same time, it is also true that no one is very much clear what he is going to do in days to come. As far as we are concerned, we have been shifted to Audit wing of GST. But it is going to take at least six months for things to be streamlined and everyone in the system to be familiar with exactly what and how one have to perform his task,? said Administrative Officer Anil Kumar, who has been transferred to Audit wing with office at Ashok Nagar-Argora Road. ?It used to be large tax office earlier. But now that entire GST wing is combined in only two offices for whole Jharkhand, one in Ranchi and another in Jamshedpur, we are going to have three different verticals coming in this office and none of the verticals is clear about their workplace and other things. We are in process of setting up all those things,? added Kumar. Meanwhile, ex-Deputy Chief Minister and AJSU Chief Sudesh Mahto has said that the GST was good for traders in State. He, however, added that government needed to listen to the traders? problems and help them getting their issues solved.",,,
184,,"While responding to a question in the Lok Sabha on Friday, the government said that it has not studied or assessed the ?impacts and after-effects? of demonetisation. The minister of state for finance, P. Radhakrishnan, responded with a ?no? when asked if the government had studied the impacts of demonetisation on the economy. On November 8, 2016, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the decision to suddenly demonetise notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000. It led to severe hardships suffered by almost the entire population in the country. Modi had argued that a large part of the currency will be returned putting an end to the stock held as black money. Recently, the agriculture ministry hadÿadmittedÿto a parliamentary standing committee that demonetisation caused severe hardship for farmers. It said that due to the withdrawal of currency notes, farmers were unable to buy seeds and fertilisers when it was time for them to sow. ?India?s 263 million farmers live mostly in the cash economy. Millions of farmers were unable to get enough cash to buy seeds and fertilisers for their winter crops. Even bigger landlords faced a problem such as paying daily wages to the farmers and purchasing agriculture needs for growing crops,? the ministry had said. However, a week later the agriculture ministryÿwithdrewÿthe report and served show cause notices to officers who were responsible for the earlier report. The new report submitted by the agriculture ministry said that demonetisation had caused no adverse impacts on farmers in the country. P. Radhakrishnan also said in his response on Friday that 99.3% of the money in circulation was returned to the RBI. ?As per data published in Annual Report 2017-18 of the Reserve Bank of India, the total value of Specified Bank Notes (SBNs) in circulation as on November 8, 2016, post verification and reconciliation, was Rs 15,417.93 billion, and the total value of SBNs returned from circulation was Rs 15,310.73 billion,? he said.",,,
185,,"With nearly 99% of banned Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes back with the RBI, questions are now being raised about the economic rationale and success of demonetisation, and whether it could hurt the economy not just in the near term but also in the medium term. How do the ground realities compare with some of the stated aims of demonetisation? By withdrawing high-value currency notes, the government had reckoned that those holding unaccounted cash or black money would not deposit it in the banking system, thereby hitting this hoard. The Prime Minister had said it was important to isolate the dishonest. The expectation was that notes worth over Rs 4 lakh crore wouldn?t return to the central bank. Now, with 98.96% of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes back, the bottom has been knocked out of that argument. What it indicates is that unaccounted funds could be in forms other than cash, such as realty and gold. Although this was not explicitly mentioned as a major policy objective when demonetisation was announced on November 8, 2016, the government subsequently said that one of the aims was to bring about a shift from a cash-based economy towards more digital or electronic forms of transaction. In the first flush after the withdrawal of high-value notes, with most people short of cash because of restrictions, there was a spurt in electronic transactions ? through prepaid wallets, debit and credit cards, NEFT (National Electronic Fund Transfer). From 671.49 million transactions in November last year, it rose to 957.50 million in December at the end of the government?s deadline on cash withdrawal. Subsequently, however, electronic transactions headed southwards as the lack of infrastructure started showing, including a shortage of PoS (point of sale) machines, with manufacturers unable to supply a high number of machines in short time as the demand for these soared.",,,
186,,"Demonetisation as a means of tackling the black economy was destined to fail. It was carried out on the incorrect premise that black money means cash. It was thought that if cash was squeezed out, the black economy would be eliminated. But cash is only one component of black wealth: about 1% of it. It has now been confirmed that 98.8% of demonetised currency has come back to the Reserve Bank of India. Further, of the ?16,000 crore that is still out, most of it is accounted for. In brief, not even 0.01% of black money has been extinguished. Black money is a result of black income generation. This is produced by various means which are not affected by the one-shot squeezing out of cash. Any black cash squeezed out by demonetisation would then quickly get regenerated. So, there is little impact of demonetisation on the black economy, on either wealth or incomes. The government is highly embarrassed, and to cover it up, it has again changed the goalpost. It now argues that it is good that black money has been deposited in the banks because those depositing it can now be caught. But the government had tried to prevent people from depositing demonetised currency by changing rules during the 50-day period. It is now fighting hard in the Supreme Court against giving one more chance to deposit the demonetised notes that may have been left with the old and the infirm. The government changed the goalpost earlier in November 2016 when it suggested that the real aim of demonetisation was a cashless society. Now it says that idle money has come into the system, the cash-to-GDP ratio will decline, the tax base will expand, and so on. But none of these required demonetisations and could and should have been implemented independently. Further, anticipating the failure of demonetisation in 2016 itself, the government started saying that demonetisation is only one of the many steps to tackle the black economy. The government?s argument that cash coming back to the banks will enable it to catch the generators of black income, and there will be formalisation of the economy, does not hold. Much of the cash in the system is held by the tens of millions of businesses as working capital and by the more than 25 crore households that need it for their day-to-day transactions.",,,
187,,"Tax evaders managed to legalise their ill-gotten gains? At least this is what the numbers make us feel as 99.3 per cent of demonetised notes have returned into the system revealed the annual report of 2017-18 released by RBI on Wednesday.ÿThe numbers have come after almost two years since the demonetisation was announced on November 8, 2016. RBI in its annual report for 2017-18 said counting the demonetised notes is over. Of the Rs 15.41 lakh crore worth Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in circulation on November 8, 2016, when the demonetisation was announced, notes worth Rs 15.31 lakh core (99.3 per cent) have been returned. The ?humungous task of processing and verification of specified bank notes (SBNs) was achieved,? it said. This meant just Rs 10,720 crore of the junked currency did not return to the banking system. Political parties were quick to corner the BJP-led Narendra Modi government that demonetised high-value currency notes to curb black money. The withdrawal of notes had sparked an acute shortage of cash in India and hit the economic growth. The bad hangover sustained for months as businesses were hit and lakhs of people lost jobs, while 104 people died standing in long queues struggling to get their old currency exchanged or deposited. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram slammed the government after the RBI report saying the Indian economy had suffered due to the note ban by way of job loss, closure of industries and the GDP growth. ?Indian economy lost 1.5 per cent of GDP in terms of growth. That alone was a loss of Rs 2.25 lakh crore a year. Over 100 lives were lost. 15 crore daily wage earners lost livelihood for several weeks. Thousands of SMEs were shut. Lakhs of jobs were destroyed,? Chidambaram tweeted. In a series of tweets, the former finance minister also said RBI figure has suggested that the government had actually demonetised only Rs 13,000 crore and the ?country paid a huge price? for it. But RBI has said Rs 10,720 crore of the junked currency didn?t return to the banking system. Chidambaram said every rupee of the Rs 15.42 lakh crore, barring a small sum of Rs 13,000 crore, has come back to RBI. ?I suspect the bulk of the Rs 13,000 crore is currency in Nepal and Bhutan and some that was lost or destroyed. Remember who had said that Rs 3 lakh crore will not come back and that will be a gain for the government!,? he said. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said her apprehensions about the impact of demonetisation on the Indian economy had been held true by RBI report. ?As soon as the draconian demonetisation was announced on November 8, 2016, I immediately sensed by intuition that this is a big anti-people measure. It will severely affect the common people of the country, especially, farmers, unorganised sector, small entrepreneurs and hard-working middle class. Today, RBI in its annual report has vindicated our apprehension,? Banerjee wrote on her Facebook page. Quoting RBI report, the Trinamool Congress supremo said 99.3 per cent of the demonetised money has come back to the banking system. ?My first question now is ? where has the black money gone?? she remarked. Raising doubts about the entire demonetisation exercise, Mamata asked if it was a ?scheme hatched to allow some black money holders to quietly convert their black money into white?. The Modi government had listed curbing black money as the primary intention of the move, along with making India a less cash-based economy. But the goal posts kept shifting in the weeks and months since with the government citing several reasons to demonetise high value notes such as to choke terror funding, bribery, increasing tax base and checking counterfeit notes. Interestingly, compared with the previous year, there was an increase of 35 per cent in counterfeit notes detected in the denomination of Rs 100, while there was a noticeable increase of 154.3 per cent in counterfeit notes detected in the denomination of Rs 50. In new series of banknotes in the denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 2000, counterfeit notes detected during 2017-18 were 9,892 and 17,929 against 199 and 638, respectively, during the previous year.",,,
188,,"On November 8, 2016, in the evening, the Prime Minister of the country Narendra Modi announced on the television that post mid-night all the currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 will become invalid.ÿ This single decision was taken to flush out 86 per cent of the currency of the world?s seventh largest economy. It was termed as demonetisation. In the past, the world over, there have been a few such attempts but not one was successful. No expert has ever proposed such a step. The economists by and large have never endorsed such a line of action. So what prompted the Government of the day to make such an announcement? Was it the decision of one individual or the collective wisdom of the Cabinet? Were the experts consulted at all and was their opinion given any heed while going ahead with demonetisation? Several thoughts came to one?s mind on that day: was it a dictatorial decision? Was it a whimsical decision? Or was it sheer economic adventurism or political expediency which guided this decision? Read on to grasp the myth and the reality of demonetisation. We were told by the Government and the spokespersons of the ruling party that demonetisation was the single most important step to curb black money and digitise the Indian economy. The myth purported was that demonetisation would completely eliminate black money from the Indian economy. The reality is that as per the RBI report, 99.3 percent of the demonetised currency has crept back into the economy! Demonetisation was professed to be an attack on crony capitalists; in reality it broke the back of India?s teeming millions; the low and middle-income groups were worst affected. Black money recovered from the system after demonetisation was expected to be ploughed back into the economy as public investments in infrastructure and other public welfare projects; the reality is that demonetisation choked small and medium enterprises and brought millions of daily wage earners in the country on the brink of economic despair and starvation. Instead of being a well-thought out scheme with a clear implementation plan demonetisation resulted in serpentine queues of millions of under-privileged Indians for weeks on end resulting in what some authentic sources say the death of over a hundred people. A similar exercise in a Latin American country a few years ago had caused widespread riots and looting of banks; it goes to the credit of the common folk of this great country who bore the brunt of demonetisation with courage and fortitude. In retrospect, they were all misled by the myth that demonetisation was a fight against black money and corruption. On the second anniversary of the deed recently, the myth was shattered and the stark reality was evident to the people of this country. Demonetisation has proved to be a dictatorial and mindless act keeping short term political gains in mind. Those political gains were achieved in the State elections which followed in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. But, these short term gains will certainly be reversed in Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and the States which went to poll recently. Short term political expediency will give way to long term political loss. The myth is shattered. Remember, you can fool some people all the time, all people some of the time but not all the people all the time. The people of India will no longer be fooled and they will respond in a quiet and peaceful manner through the ballot box in 2019. Demonetisation was expected to benefit all; this was another myth. In reality, it benefitted one man, one party and the crony capitalists under their care; both politically and financially. The highest amount of cash exchange happened in the banks in a particular State where a particular person, chairperson of a particular political party was on the board of directors. In the name of digitisation of the economy one particular digital payment company benefited, their consumers and profits increased manifolds while the common man was majorly inconvenienced and the economy suffered. For small gains, the whole nation was put through tremendous hardships. The money spent on printing new currency and recalibrating the ATMs with the damaging effect of countless livelihoods was never considered as a cost by the Government at all. Small businesses were affected-many haven?t been able to recover even now, two years down the line. As the fiasco of demonetisation unfolded, the reasons for it as per the Government kept changing. From curbing black money, it changed into encouraging digital economy to starving the cash flow to terrorists and stone pelters to stopping counterfeit currency etc. The goal post kept changing almost every day. However, now we know for sure all these were myths peddled by the Government for most of the cash is back in the system, we are back to the same level of cash transactions, terrorists are as active as before and Rs 2000 note is easiest to counterfeit. Demonetisation helped the rich to convert their black money into accounted cash. Another benefit of demonetisation was supposed to be the increasing tax compliance. The numbers of returns filed have surely increased however the quantum of increase in the tax collection is not known as yet, whether it was worth the pain the people and the economy had to suffer. It was a misadventure, of a kind which should never happen with any country, its economy and its people. Perhaps, if RBI had taken a firm stand as it did recently with regards to access to its reserves, the nation would have been spared of much of misery. Thus, one wonders if demonetisation was a carefully thought out step to benefit the national economy and its people or was it a Tughlaqi idea to benefit a party and its short term agenda.",,,
189,,"The Reserve Bank of India released its annual report for 2017-18 on August 29, 2018. That 99.3% of the demonetised currency has come back to the banking system has been the most talked about part of the report, but this is not exactly new information. It was already known that most demonetised currency had come back to the banking system. The statistics worth looking at in this year?s report are those which give details about the denomination-wise break-up of the currency in circulation. These figures are better than last year?s figures because now the remonetisation process can be assumed to have been fully completed. Not much seems to have changed in terms of value. Slightly more than one-third of the total currency in circulation was in denominations greater than Rs 500 at the end of March 2018, which is nearly the same as the corresponding values in March 2015 and 2016, the last two years before demonetisation. However, things have changed drastically in terms of volume. The share of currency in denominations greater than Rs 500 has more than halved in March 2018, compared to what it was in March 2016. This is basically the result of ?2000 notes replacing Rs 1000 notes. In a perfect world, this should not matter. The supply of currency both in value and volume terms has increased compared to what it was before demonetisation. But this could have changed things in a big way in the conduct of day-to-day transactions. Here?s why. A person conducting a retail cash transaction above Rs 500 in the pre-demonetisation period would have needed a lesser amount in change than she would in the post-demonetisation world. The reason being, she will now have to get a Rs 2000 note changed and not a Rs 1000 note which was the case earlier. Ceteris paribus this is bound to lead to an increase in transaction demand for notes with denominations up to Rs 500. Given the fact that the share of currency notes of denominations up to Rs 500 has not changed before and after demonetisation, there is a probability of increased cash crunch in day to day cash transactions. Should the RBI have altered the distribution of currency in circulation after demonetisation in favour of lower denomination notes? The 2017-18 Annual Report?s statistics on indent (reacquisition) and supply of different denominations of currency notes supports this argument. Indeed, through 2017, and 2018, several news reports have said RBI is stepping up printing of smaller denomination currency notes. The shortfall in supply compared to indent of ?100 notes was more than 60% in 2017-18.",,,
190,,"On November 20, 2016, I was in a village in Hooghly district with other volunteers of our small non-governmental organization, waiting to interview applicants for one of our training programmes. We were in aÿsamabay krishi unnayan samitiÿ(a cooperative society set up, as the name suggests, for the benefit of farmers) at the invitation of theÿsamiti?sÿmembers, who wanted us to conduct one of our courses there. Usually, these interviews are congenial, even jolly, affairs, with a lot of banter and crosstalk; occasionally, we would encounter someone who was clearly unfitted for our course (usually by virtue of belonging to a higher income group than our targeted beneficiaries) and sometimes there were far too many applicants than we could possibly accommodate; but this time there were just 28 applicants for 20-odd places in our course, so it should have been smooth sailing. Except that it wasn?t. An air of gloom, even desperation, seemed to hang over the proceedings; applicant after applicant spoke of the dire uncertainty of their future, not just in economic terms but in ways that embraced pretty much all aspects of their lives ? the impossibility of being certain if a daughter would be able to go to college, a nephew get married, a chronically ill parent receive treatment, a close relative get a loan to set up a small shop, and so on and on and on. Somewhat surprised to begin with, we were soon struck by the realization that it was less than a fortnight since the historic announcement of demonetization on November 8 2016, and just six days since the notification by the Reserve Bank of India that district central cooperative banks would no longer be allowed to accept deposits or exchange the now worthless 500- and 1,000-rupee notes. Virtually everyone we met that day had the bulk of her or his savings in cooperative societies which, in turn, did the bulk of their business with DCCBs. In the few days that DCCBs had accepted deposits and exchanged currency notes from SKUSs, transactions worth hundreds of crores had already taken place. Although people had had to stand in line for hours, most SKUSs had risen to the occasion and increased their work hours and the number of people at their counters. But now, it was all over. Not a single one of the people we met that day ? the applicants for our course, family and friends who had accompanied them, members of the SKUS, other folk from the village ? had any idea of how, if ever, this nightmare would end. This was the miasma of gloom and fear that hung over the meeting room that cool November afternoon 25 months ago. Things didn?t really change much in the following weeks and months and a year later they were still limping along at best, asÿsamitiÿmembers kept telling us. It was not until next year, and after much litigation, that DCCBs were finally allowed to deposit the demonetized notes in their vaults with the RBI. These memories swum to the surface as I read Meera H. Sanyal?sÿThe Big Reverse: How Demonetization Knocked India Outÿ? an account of the devastating effects of demonetization on the times and lives of hundreds of millions of ordinary Indians. Sanyal is one of India?s most successful bankers, someone who has served in top positions in some of the world?s largest banks and financial institutions. She is no air-headed socialist; on the contrary, she champions markets, competition, and the need to encourage entrepreneurship, small-scale and large. Like most of us, she believes the stated aims of demonetization, as announced by the country?s prime minister on the night of November 8, 2016 ? eradicating black money, ending corruption and stopping terror-funding ? are eminently laudable objectives that no patriotic Indian ought to argue with. To these three primary goals, she adds five others announced by the government?s spokespersons in the days following demonetization: moving to a cashless society, expanding the tax base, integrating the informal sector of the economy with the formal, lowering interest rates and bringing down real estate prices. In the sixth chapter, ?Demonetization Report Card?, she draws on government statistics to show how not a single one of these eight objectives came even close to being achieved. In her other five chapters, not including the Introduction and Conclusion, Sanyal looks at the effects of demonetization from the angle of people, institutions, economics and history. And what she says does not make for pretty reading. I am no economist or political scientist, but in over three decades of trying to understand literary texts, and by speaking with people from a wide range of backgrounds, I have understood two things: stories matter and memory is short. For most salaried city-dwellers like me, demonetization was a shock to the system, but a shock we recovered from fairly rapidly. In the days immediately after November 8, 2016 many (most?) neighbourhood shops openedÿkhatasÿfor their regular customers, where purchases were noted down and payment asked for only after the total had inched close to Rs 2,000; more establishments started accepting card payments; even queueing up outside banks and ATMs turned into something resembling a street-sideÿadda, and the frequent (and often contradictory) orders issued by the RBI provided much grist for the mills ofÿparaÿhumorists. Yes, there was hardship, which we encountered not always first-hand but often from those who worked in our homes or ferried fresh provisions to our doorstep or ran a localÿchaiÿshop; and many times we helped them out in small but not insignificant ways ? by not asking for change, by taking their now-useless notes and giving them fresh legal tender in exchange, by making advances against a future month?s salary, and so forth. Things were far worse in non-urban areas. There is little data on how many people lost livelihoods in villages, how many patients went untreated, how much additional interest had to be given to usurious moneylenders to pay for daily necessities, how many social gatherings and family events had to be cancelled or drastically curtailed? yet anyone who has even a nodding acquaintance with rural India will have heard many of these stories of loss and despair. On the 21st day of the second month in the third year after demonetization most of those who read this paper will have probably forgotten the hardships undergone by ordinary people, the chaos created in every sector of the economy, and the failures swept quietly under the carpet by the architects of demonetization. Through her meticulously documented, carefully crafted, deeply felt and, most of all, profoundly human book, Sanyal has given us reason to remember the many stories that went into the making of this strange and, ultimately, tragic chapter in our country?s recent history.",,,
191,,"Last week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)ÿdisclosedÿthat all butÿ?ÿ10,720 crore of theÿ?ÿ15.4 trillion of demonetized high-value currencies, is back in the banking system. In the process, RBI formally belied the government?s much touted ex-ante claim that at leastÿ?ÿ3 trillion of this money, since it was stored as illegal cash, will be extinguished, serving up an unexpected fiscal bonanza. The political bloodletting that followed once again ensured that issues continue to be obfuscated and degenerate into a blame game targeting potential electoral gains. The actual outcome of this audacious move, for several reasons, is far more nuanced. For one,ÿthe expected economic gains from demonetisation, as most critics have rightly argued, was questionable, especially, the fundamental claim about a substantial chunk of high-value currency getting extinguished. This claim assumed that most of the black money, or illegal wealth, was being stashed away in cash. With the benefit of hindsight, this was obviously an erroneous assumption; needless to say, policy mandarins should have known better. Worse, even the cash holdings were easily laundered by exploiting various loopholes. This leads to the second point about how, after the initial shock, money was laundered through mules?exactly why we ended up with serpentine queues?and some complicit personnel, including in the banking system. Yes; the Union government got egg on its face, as it was unable to contain laundering. True, but it is a resounding wake-up call about a broken system. It has long been suspected that the delivery system in India, especially of public goods, has been thoroughly corrupt and rendered inefficient?exactly why the parallel economy financed by black money has taken root. The hollowing out of institutions, key to the sound functioning of a democracy, has only exacerbated this problem. Third, flowing from the above, is the underlying politics of demonetisation. Unveiling the move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had emphasized the importance of demonetisation of high-value currencies in targeting black money. Since illegal wealth is stored by the corrupt, the general populace read this as the singular message of demonetisation?something that contributed to the record victory the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) achieved in the Uttar Pradesh election soon after. The sense was, like this column has said in the past, that the premium on honesty was being restored. Indeed, the move was ham-handed and riddled with avoidable administrative glitches. But the scale and audacity of the move sent out a strong signal that the government was determined to pursue the rule of law. The introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) last year has only spurred India to move even further away from the discretion-based approach. Fourthly, it is more than just coincidence that there has been a marked broadening of India?s direct tax base. Information sharing among various tax arms of the government has grown dramatically over the last decade and more. The introduction of GST has only underlined the audit trails in economic transactions, making it that much more difficult to conceal money. Finance minister Arun Jaitley had disclosed last week, in a social media post, thatÿthe number of income tax returnsÿalmost doubled from 38 million in 2013-14 to 68.6 million in fiscal 2017-18. While it was never the Plan A of the demonetisation strategy, the growth in digital money has got a big leg-up. With e-commerce poised to accelerate, there is every reason to believe that this will only gather further momentum. Exactly why foreign investors,ÿincluding Warren Buffet, are lining up for a slice of the action. Finally, the biggest let-down has been that politics of confrontation has denied the country a fair debate on demonetisation. Disruption in Parliament ensured that we never really heard from the finance minister on the logic of the move, the extent of black money and so on. Neither did we get to hear the critics. (In contrast, in 1991, when then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao unleashed an unprecedented acceleration in reforms, Parliament witnessed a revealing debate.)",,,
192,,"Twenty-one years ago, on January 27, 1996, a raid on the offices of the Animal Husbandry department in Chaibasa unearthed the Rs 950-crore fodder scam that embroiled then Bihar chief minister Lalu Yadav in a lifelong tussle with the CBI. Large-scale embezzlement of government treasury funds given to non-existent companies for purchase and supply of cattle fodder in Bihar in the 1990s was the highlight of this scam. The fodder scam started with small-scale embezzlement done by low level government employees to show transfer of some fake funds. When it grew, it also started to include businesses and politicians, increasing the amount of money embezzled. The then Comptroller and Auditor General of India, TN Chaturvedi, noticed delays in submissions of monthly accounts of the Bihar treasury and warned of possible laundering of funds in 1985. The Animal Husbandry department had made fraudulent withdrawals of big bills of Rs 1,000 crore in the name of medicines during the chief ministerial tenure of Lalu Yadav. However, the raid only happened in 1996. In March of the same year, the Patna High Court directed CBI to investigate the scam. As the investigation progressed, the CBI formally requested the then Governor of Bihar for permission to prosecute the CM. In June 1997, the CBI filed chargesheets against Lalu Yadav and 55 other co-accused. The accused had 63 cases registered against them under three sections:ÿIPC Sections 420 (forgery) and 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy) and Section 13 (b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Lalu Yadav resigned as chief minister as his then partyÿJanata Dalÿpressured him to not hold office while being under criminal prosecution. He dissociated from Janata Dal and formed his own partyÿRashtriya Janata Dal. He resigned in July due to mounting pressure but installed his wife Rabri Devi as the chief minister who won  the vote of confidence in July 1997.A case of Disproportionate Assets was registered against him in 1998, with Rabri Devi being named as a co-accused for abetting the crime. The Income Tax department had said that Lalu had gathered Rs 46 lakh from the government treasury. The duo surrendered to a CBI court in 2000. However, Rabri was able to get bail while Lalu Yadav stayed in jail. A month later, Patna Hight Court granted him bail which was extended several times. By this time, the new state of Jharkhand had been formed and the fodder scam cases were transferred to Ranchi. Aÿspecial CBI court in Ranchi acquitted both Lalu and his wife on December 18, 2006 in the DA case. In 2012, nine years after the chargesheet against 44 people was filed in a cased related to the multi-crore fodder scam, the CBI framed charges against Lalu Yadav and others. They were all convicted by a Patna CBI court in 2013, a judgment that Lalu Yadav contested.ÿThe conviction alsoÿdisqualified and barred him from contesting any election for 11 years. In 2014, Lalu moved the Jharkhand HC challenging the verdict of the CBI court. The Supreme Court in May ordered a trial against Lalu Prasad, and directed that it be complete within 9 months, after it allowed a CBI plea which opposed the dropping of charges against the former chief minister.",,,
193,,"By setting aside the Jharkhand High Court's verdict, the Supreme Court on Monday paved the way for a fresh trial of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad, former Bihar Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra, and other accused in a criminal case involving the withdrawal of money and falsification of records from the Deoghar Treasury in connection with the ?900-crore fodder scam. Two decades have passed since the scam was unearthed. It involved politicians and bureaucrats belonging to successive administrations siphoning off several crores of rupees, on the pretext of purchasing livestock feed, over a period of 20 years. It was one of the early cases where sitting legislators were convicted and had to lose their Assembly and parliamentary seats. It is also the reason why a popular leader such as Mr. Prasad is not contesting elections, even though he played a key role in the RJD-JD(U) combine wresting power in Bihar. The fodder scam is a collective term for a set of 64 cases, of which 53 were litigated in Ranchi. It all began in 1985 when then CAG T.N. Chaturvedi sniffed out a possible embezzlement of funds from the Bihar Treasury and various departments. The CAG noticed delay in monthly account submissions from the State and also noted small scale false expense reports. Ten years later, the 'small scale' embezzlements added up to Rs. 900 crores. In 1996, State Finance Secretary V.S. Dubey ordered district magistrates and deputy commissioners of all districts to go into cases of excessive withdrawals. Around the same time, then Deputy Commissioner Amit Khare raided the office of the Animal Husbandry Department at Chaibasa. It unearthed a huge cache of documents showing illegal withdrawals and revealed a nexus between officials and suppliers. The State government instituted two separates one-man commissions of inquiry. The first was headed by State Development Commissioner Phoolchand Singh and was constituted on January 30, 1996. However, this one was aborted when Mr. Singh's name began to figure in the charge sheet. The second commission was headed by Justice Sarwar Ali and was instituted on March 10, 1996. Meanwhile, the Patna High Court ordered the CBI to take over the probe after a public interest litigation was filed by State BJP president Sushil Kumar Modi. Both Mr. Mishra and Mr. Prasad were named in the CBI's charge sheet in July 1997. Succumbing to pressure, Mr. Prasad gave up the Chief Minister post, but not before installing his wife Rabri Devi in the post. The Jharkhand High Court continued hearing the cases after Bihar was bifurcated. The fodder scam didn't help the Opposition much as Mr. Prasad, and the RJD emerged triumphant in the 2000 elections. Ms. Rabri Devi survived a vote of confidence and became the Chief Minister with the support of the Congress and the JMM. Mr. Prasad contested in the Rajya Sabha election and later in the general elections. He even served as Railway Minister between 2004 and 2009, when the trials were under way. The BJP and the JD(U) effectively turned the scam into a poll plank, which led the alliance to power in 2005. The combine governed the State until they broke it in 2014. In 2013, Mr. Prasad and Mr. Mishra were convicted in the Chaibasa Treasury case, the first among the 53 cases. Both the leaders are out on bail and have appealed against their conviction. ",,,
194,,"In a setback to Lalu Prasad Yadav, the Supreme Court today ruled that the RJD leader will stand trial separately in all four fodder scam cases as it set aside the Jharkhand high court order which had dropped conspiracy charges against him. A bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra and Amitava Roy directed the trial court to complete the proceedings against 68-year-old Yadav and others within nine months. ?We have held that for each offence there will be a separate trial,? the bench said. The fodder scam relates to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 900 crore by the Animal Husbandry Department from various district when Lalu was the chief minister. Former Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra and former state chief secretary Sajal Chakraborty are also accused in the case. The apex court, while setting aside the 2014 high court order which had stayed the trial against Yadav after conviction in one of the cases, said the high court should have been consistent in its findings and not have given different views for different sets of accused in a case. It also pulled up the CBI for delay in filing the appeal against the high court order in the case and said the probe agency?s director should have looked into this important matter and deputed an officer to pursue the case. The CBI had challenged the 2014 order of the Jharkhand high court quashing four pending fodder scam cases against him on the grounds that a person convicted in one case could not be tried in similar cases based on same witnesses and evidences. The apex court had in November 2016 pulled up Mishra for allegedly dragging and delaying the appeal filed by CBI challenging the quashing of four pending fodder scam cases against him. The high court had on November 14, 2014 upheld the CBI plea to continue proceedings in the trial court against Yadav under two sections while dropping other charges on the grounds that a person cannot be tried twice for the same offence. The charges are in connection with fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 96 lakh during the chief ministerial tenure of the RJD chief.",,,
195,,"Despite the use of the term ""surgical strikes"", the Indians definitely did not airdrop commandos to hit ""launching pads of militants"" inside Pakistani-held territory, or conduct ground assaults deep into the Pakistan-administered side. But they did cross the Line of Control (LoC), in some cases by more than a kilometre, to hit nearby Pakistani border posts. Police officials on the Pakistani side privately concede that such a ground assault did occur in the Madarpur-Titrinot region of Poonch sector, west of Srinagar, where a Pakistani post was destroyed, and one soldier killed. In Leepa valley to the north, locals said that the Indians crossed the LoC and set up their guns on ridges directly overlooking the village of Mundakali. A Pakistani border post located at some distance east of the village was hit. Two other posts higher up in the mountains were also hit. At least four Pakistani soldiers were injured in the attack, which lasted from 05:00am until 8:00am, locals said. A similar advance by the Indians in the Dudhnial area of Neelum valley further north was beaten back by the Pakistanis. At least one Pakistani soldier was injured - reports of a dead soldier could not be independently verified by the BBC. The Pakistani army described the exchanges as nothing more than cross-border firing, albeit in a more co-ordinated fashion and all along the LoC. Officials said two soldiers were killed in the attacks - one in Poonch, and one in Bhimber sector, further south. Defence minister Khwaja Asif later said a total of nine soldiers were injured in the assault. Indian troops could not have hit a target and returned alive as the climb required was too steep, officials said. Nor could helicopters have been used to drop special forces given the difficult terrain and because Pakistan would have shot down the aircraft. There is no conclusive evidence to prove either side's claims - the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.",,,
196,,"Prime ministerÿNarendra Modiÿis akin to a phenomenon rarely seen in Indian or global politics. He remains extremely popular among the citizens despite efforts by many in the media and opposition to continually criticise and pull him down. When the NDA won the election in 2014 and Modi became the prime minister in the first term, he probably already had a clear strategy to uplift India into a vibrant country that met the needs of all the citizens. In his very first address, he swung into motion a grand Swacch Bharat mission: that every household must have a toilet, that open defecation becomes a thing of the past, and that dignity is brought back into the heart of the Indian citizen, particularly the woman. What India hadn?t achieved in 67 years of Independence was achieved in PM Modi?s first five-year term?India is now nearly 100% open defecation free (ODF) compared to 38.7% in October 2014.

He then turned his attention to financial and digital inclusion. Recognising that, in this new age of knowledge-economy-led growth, individual and national development are intimately connected to a citizen?s ability to access digital and banking platforms, he launched Digital India and drove the next wave of growth via the India Stack, where every Indian would have access to personal identification (Aadhaar), internet and mobile connectivity, and bank account (Jan Dhan). To date, 90% of Indians have Aadhaar, and Jan Dhan has provided more than 40 crore with a bank account digitally accessible via their mobile?a significant majority for the first time.

India Stack has also unlocked productivity leaps in subsidy and relief delivery via the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system; Rs 12 lakh crore has been disbursed via DBT resulting in a savings of Rs 1.7 lakh crore. Forty-two crore beneficiaries received relief and minimum income support during the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. India?s digital inclusion drive has been a massive success, by domestic and global standards.

The distribution of gas stoves and connections has made a phenomenal difference to rural family health, particularly the women. Before the Ujjwala Yojana gas cylinder distribution, smoke and ensuing lung problems were commonplace. With smoke-free cooking enabled by gas stoves, this has ceased to be a problem. The number of gas connections increased from 12 crore in 2014 to 25 crore.

PM Modi then turned his attention towards industry reforms with demonetisation, GST, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). These were undertaken to reform corporate India and rid the country of crony capitalism. These reforms have drawn criticism from many, perhaps forgetting that demonetisation has broken the back of the black money class. The use of black money has reduced considerably. Long-term habits to deal in black money have been mostly converted into the default use of digital banking systems.

GST has been an outstanding success towards India?s move to reduce supply chain costs, which today account for 14% of GDP as against 6% in China and 5% in the US. Seventeen taxes were rolled into one, providing a uniform system for the first time in 70 years, and effective indirect taxes have reduced. In its first month, the system onboarded 56 lakh filers. For various reasons, GST has not shown buoyancy, but one can expect to see the effect in the future.

Infrastructure development has been another significant push of the Modi government. Rural road connectivity, railways development, and construction of high-speed roads, ports and airports have taken off at a fast pace?all vital ingredients to increase India?s productivity and reduce supply chain costs.

Make-in-India, at commencement, was not a great success because it was cast in the traditional mould without a focus on the policy changes and incentives required. Subsequently, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for large scale electronics proved successful?mobile manufacturing has risen multifold, making India an exporter. Merging PLI-like strategies with the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan push could make Make-in-India a success.

PM Modi?s next focus was health. Ayushman Bharat was launched to provide health insurance cover to the millions of uninsured in India; 12.6 crore e-cards have been issued, and 1.2 crore hospital admissions were managed through this scheme. The next frontier in health is the Bharat Health Stack, built on the India Stack architecture, which will further improve access and management of healthcare in India.

Other reforms that have the potential for sizeable economic impact have been in simplifying labour laws, incentivising and reclassifying MSMEs, especially with the guaranteed loan programmes, reduction in corporate tax rates, and deregulating the farm sector, which will empower farmers to double their income by 2022.

The emphasis on employment needs better policies and focus, but it will certainly improve when the effects from these other reforms bear fruit.

During the Covid-19 pandemic and national lockdowns, PM Modi?s focus was on ensuring the lives and livelihoods of the bottom-of-the-pyramid. All the reforms and digital advancements made earlier are proving extremely useful in these difficult times. Rations and minimum income support were extended to 80 crore Indians, which wouldn?t have been possible without Digital India and India Stack. PM Modi?s housing programme has also been an outstanding success in bringing dignity to crores of Indians with pucca housing; 1.1 crore houses have been built, targeting a total of 2.95 crores by 2022. The return of migrants during the Covid-lockdown has accelerated this programme and enabled them to build a life in their hometowns. With this acceleration, the timeline to build a house has reduced from 120 days to a 45-60 day horizon.

At this rate, by 2022, all Indians will have access to basic necessities?housing, clean water, gas connections, bank accounts, internet and mobile connectivity, road access, and education?especially with the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020. For a population of 138 crore, these are remarkable achievements. PM Modi had a clear strategy to reach this point, unambiguous aspirations and a structured sequence of reforms and policies.

Previous political regimes launched schemes like Garibi Hatao, which were unsuccessful because they focused more on politics and less on execution. PM Modi has inverted this paradigm, and personally monitors and reviews progress on the programmes. He leverages technology platforms wherever possible to ensure the programmes are executed as soon as possible. He sets clear priorities for himself and his government. He has not fallen victim to unnecessary politics. His foreign policy moves have made the Middle East friends of India, and the entire world looks more favourably on the country now. Standing up to hegemonic China, too, has improved our standing in the world.

No prime minister has done as much for India?s development as PM Modi has in his six years. As India celebrates PM Modi?s birthday, citizens all over the country pay tribute to this remarkable leader.",,,
197,,"It is a fact, not just an opinion, that Prime MinisterÿNarendra Modiÿstraddles India?s political firmament like a colossus. This is acknowledged by all, friend and foe, expert or novice. As he begins his 20th year in public life ? he took oath as Gujarat?s chief minister for the first time this week 19 years ago ? his ascendance and dominance is worth understanding better. In 1987, when he joined the BJP, he had already made a name for himself as a tireless worker, quick on the uptake, making valuable contributions, and as a charismatic and strategic thinker. Nevertheless, as is all too well known, his debut as Gujarat?s chief minister was to quickly become a trial by fire, the kind few leaders survive.
No politician in independent India has been demonised in such a relentless, Goebbelsian manner as him, and none has withstood it all with such resilience and courage. Despite years of concerted attacks on him by the then-dominant mainstream media, his popularity only grew, his grip on both politics and governance only got firmer. That ability to go beyond the circumstances in which he found himself has been a crucially important trait since his youth. From going past traditional familial constraints to wandering, exploring, seeking, and discovering his purpose, his is a classic journey that many young idealists fantasise about, but rarely dare to attempt. The fact that his detractors tried to persistently target him, despite him prevailing in trials in courts and in public opinion, was resented by his support base. That not only helped consolidate his hold over them in the state, but also started the bandwagon of similar support nationwide.

A lesser man might have been content with that, perhaps even planned an extension of his entrenchment as Gujarat?s undisputed leader. Instead, Modi decided to, and succeeded in, transforming his image into that of Mr Development. It did not happen overnight, and it did not happen easily. He had to work against the tide of initial opposition from many quarters, not least of all significant leaders of industry and their associations. Slowly, but surely, he built a track record of decisiveness, of laying out the red carpet for investment, of out-of-the-box solutions for age-old bottlenecks like inconsistent power supply, and all that while avoiding the taint of corruption. Even as a CM he started acquiring a global reputation as a can-do leader.

That is not to say he gave up being the champion of the broadest section of the electorate, nor on his passion for a resurgent, modern India that also took pride in its ancient heritage. He has all along spoken out against the hypocrisy of those who represented what passed for secularism and liberalism in India, but made a mockery of that with their policies of appeasement, pandering to the fears and schisms in sections of society instead of trying to unite them. It is surely one of the great ironies of modern times that the person who marshalled the political will to bring about Triple Talaq reform in India was not from among those secularists and liberals, but one who has been unceasingly vilified by them.

The fact is, this prime minister has been just as staunch a reformer on a wide range issues, taking on established shibboleths. These include not just social changes, but also stunning advances on political and economic reforms that had long been given lip service by all but had also acquired the aura of being unachievable. The latest of these is the recent farm bills that have been advocated by virtually everyone, except perhaps far-left ideologues, for decades. Looking back to the national political scenario a dozen years ago, it was obvious to many that Modi would almost inevitably lead the nation sooner or later. Even as the government of the day got ever more deeply mired in corruption scandals, infighting and palace intrigues, it continued to be blithely oblivious to the mood of the people. When the then prime minister, a member of a minority community himself, spoke of minorities having the first right on the nation?s resources, a tipping point was reached.

In the other corner stood a long-standing chief minister, exuding charisma, personal honesty, transparency, and good governance. But also unafraid to speak bluntly, against nepotism in politics, against cosseting sections of the population in ghettos, both physical and legislative, and was confidently asserting nationalism and an Indian renaissance. Born of this confluence of circumstances and preparation were such slogans as ?sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas,? and ?minimum government, maximum governance.?

It is worth remembering that the long-entrenched elites he dislodged pushed back with a vehemence born from seeing their world evaporating before their eyes. They united to deny him early attempts at reform, such as on land acquisition, and, emboldened, thereafter opposed him tooth and nail on virtually every decision. They mocked those slogans and dubbed him a non-reformer.

And yet, reform he did, against all odds. The GST is arguably the single-biggest economic reform since Independence. And despite the persistent badmouthing of demonetisation by opponents, it triggered the transition to digitisation that made possible the large-scale monetary aid to hundreds of millions of Indians during this pandemic. The reset that he did with India?s response to cross-border terror attacks must also rank as immensely significant. In this time he has emerged as one of the most influential global leaders.

The second term has begun with a breathtaking shifting of gears, pushing through many long-pending, big-ticket reforms. And yet, while his opponents continue as if in a time warp, doubling down on their failed tactics, Narendra Modi keeps evolving, his best yet to come.",,,
198,,"The Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday decided to reach out to Delhiites for their opinion on whether the nascent party should form a minority government with Congress support. The feedback in the form of individual letters, centralised SMSs, on social networking sites such as party?s official facebook page and its website will be gathered till Sunday before deciding on government formation on Monday.

Stung by criticism that it is running away from forming a government despite Congress support, AAP announced that it would be sending out 25 lakh letters inviting people?s views. Similarly, a centralised mobile number will receive people?s single-word opinion (yes or no) through SMS.

Kejriwal on Saturday wrote to Congress and BJP asking their views on 18 issues after the lieutenant governor invited AAP to form a government. The BJP-Akali Dal (32 seats) had declined to form the government. AAP (28 seats) was the second-largest while Congress won just eight seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly. While the BJP refused to reply, the Congress? reply on Monday stated that 16 issues were administrative affairs and it was with AAP on the remaining two. The party?s political affair?s committee discussed Congress? reply, followed by a meeting of its candidates before Kejriwal went public. The meeting with candidates threw up a mixed response. Post-December 8 when result was announced, most had said they favoured re-election. But on Tuesday many said they felt that the response from ground ? especially after Kejriwal?s letter ? favoured AAP to form the government.

?The candidates were asked to gather public feedback. After all, it is not a question of personal opinion. Important is to find out what people want,? said a party leader.",,,
199,,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has decided to seek the opinion of the people on whether they should form a government in Delhi with the support of the Congress party. At the same time, the party pooh-poohed the extension of support by the Congress party, describing it as shatir (clever). AAP had decided to seek the people?s opinion as there was a strong view within the party that it should form a government with outside support of the Congress even for six months to fulfil its agenda and also to show that it can deliver, AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal said at a press conference here on Tuesday.
According to Mr. Kejriwal, there is another view in the party that the Congress will not withdraw its support till the Lok Sabha elections.
Accepting the diversity of views within the party, Mr. Kejriwal said that while a few members of the Political Affairs Committee and MLAs supported the idea of forming the government some others wanted the party to go for re-election. ?This morning we had our meeting of PAC and MLAs. Unlike the other parties, we do not take decisions in closed rooms, therefore the party decided to take people?s opinion,? he said.



The party has chalked a six-day programme during which it will organise 270 public rallies in each municipal ward to take a ?sense of people?s opinion.? Over 25 lakh copies of Mr. Kejriwal?s letter addressed to the people of Delhi will also be distributed during the opinion gathering campaign. People can send their feedback to the party through SMS, phone calls and social media. The party will complete the process by Sunday and is likely to meet the Lieutenant-Governor on Monday.",,,
200,,"A day after it sought a referendum on forming a government in Delhi with outside support of the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party received over 4.20 lakh responses through various channels. It is yet to analyse the data to ascertain their nature. ?We had sought feedback from the people of Delhi regarding their views on formation of a government. And within 24 hours, we have received over 4.2 lakh responses through different channels, including the Interactive Voice Response system, short-message service, our website and the party?s Facebook page,? an AAP spokesperson told The Hindu. The maximum number of responses were received through SMSes. ?The party has got 25 lakh pamphlets printed to reach out to the people. Our next course of action would be a door-to-door survey. The exercise will commence on Thursday. Public meetings attended by senior leaders will also be organised in all municipal wards. The data collected will be analysed and the results are expected to be out in the public domain next Monday,? the spokesperson added.
The AAP decided to go for the referendum as the deadlock over formation of the government has persisted since the BJP, the single largest party with 31 out of the 70 Assembly seats, refused to take the plunge. The AAP, with 28 seats, which was also invited by the Lieutenant-Governor for a discussion on the issue, has sought time to arrive at a decision. Describing the Congress as shatir (clever), Mr. Kejriwal said the AAP?s decision to go to the people followed a strong view within the party that they should form the government with Congress support, even if it is for six months, to fulfil its agenda and prove that it could deliver on its promises. It is learnt that some sections of the party also felt that it was trying to escape from its responsibility to govern.",,,
201,,"The NITI Aayog was formed to bring fresh ideas to the government. Its first mandate is to act as a think tank. It can be visualised as a funnel through which new and innovative ideas come from all possible sources ? industry, academia, civil society or foreign specialists ? and flow into the government system for implementation. We have regular brainstorming sessions with stakeholders from various industries and sectors. Initiatives like Ayushmaan Bharat, our approach towards artificial intelligence and water conservation measures, and the draft bill to establish the National Medical Commission to replace the Medical Council of India have all been conceptualised in NITI Aayog, and are being taken forward by the respective Ministries. In that sense, I think of NITI Aayog as an action tank rather than just a think tank. By collecting fresh ideas and sharing them with the Central and State governments, it pushes frontiers and ensures that there is no inertia, which is quite natural in any organisation or institution. If it succeeds, NITI Aayog could emerge as an agent of change over time and contribute to the Prime Minister?s agenda of improving governance and implementing innovative measures for better delivery of public services.

We also work to cut across the silos within the government. For example, India still has the largest number of malnourished children in the world. We want to reduce this number vastly, but this requires a huge degree of convergence across a number of Ministries, and between Central and State governments. NITI Aayog is best placed to achieve this convergence and push the agenda forward.

NITI Aayog is also bringing about a greater level of accountability in the system. Earlier, we had 12 Five-Year Plans, but they were mostly evaluated long after the plan period had ended. Hence, there was no real accountability.

NITI Aayog has established a Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office which collects data on the performance of various Ministries on a real-time basis. The data are then used at the highest policymaking levels to establish accountability and improve performance. This performance- and outcome-based real-time monitoring and evaluation of government work can have a significant impact on improving the efficiency of governance.

Using such data, we also come up with performance-based rankings of States across various verticals to foster a spirit of competitive federalism. That is another big mandate of NITI Aayog. We identify the best practices in different States in various sectors and then try to replicate them in other States. We also play an important role of being the States? representative in Delhi, and facilitate direct interactions with the line ministries, which can address issues in a relatively shorter time. The Atal Innovation Mission, which is also established under NITI Aayog, has already done commendable work in improving the innovation ecosystem in India. It has established more than 1,500 Atal Tinkering Labs in schools across the country and this number is expected to go up to 5,000 by March 2019. It has also set up 20 Atal Incubation Centres for encouraging young innovators and start-ups.

With its current mandate that is spread across a range of sectors and activities, and with its unique and vibrant work culture, NITI Aayog remains an integral and relevant component of the government?s plans to put in place an efficient, transparent, innovative and accountable governance system in the country.

202,,"The erstwhile Planning Commission had been on the decline since 1991, much before the final blow was delivered to it by the present regime in 2014. At some point, the charge of the Planning Commission was entrusted to eminent experts, many of whom had trained in neoliberal schools. This did not fit well with the imperative for an inclusive and equitable path of economic development in India, which is a socially hierarchical and economically iniquitous society.",,,
203,,"In the original Nehruvian vision, the public sector was entrusted with the economy, given the weak market mechanism which was dominated by mercantile capital and a feudalistic system, especially in rural areas. Even then, the Planning Commission controlled only half of the total investment in India, since what was consciously adopted was a mixed economy system. It also fitted well with our republican democratic Constitution. The rise of neoliberalism, the decline of erstwhile socialist regimes worldwide, and the rise of right-wing market fundamentalists within the country paved the way for the demise of the Planning Commission. Its replacement by NITI Aayog looks more apologetic than substantial for the task of transforming a deeply unequal society into a modern economy that ensures the welfare of all its citizens, irrespective of their social identity.

It has no role in influencing, let alone directing, public or private investment. It does not seem to have any influence in policymaking with long-term consequences (for instance, demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax). NITI Aayog is supposed to be a think tank. This implies that while generating new ideas, it maintains a respectable intellectual distance from the government of the day. Instead, what we see is uncritical praise of government-sponsored, acronym-infested schemes. It sings paeans to the virtues of the private corporate sector as the saviour of the Indian economy without realising, let alone appreciating, the foundational and socially oriented contribution of India?s vast public sector.

How can a country like India transform itself with new ideas and strategies if it doesn?t have a paradigm of planning for development? How can it lift its poor? How can we ensure that every working member of the Indian population has a decent job with at least a minimum wage and social/employment security? Why doesn?t it occur to the political leadership to ask why more than 90% of those in the workforce slog in the unorganised sector ? in small farms and tiny non-farm establishments ? with two-thirds of the total being working poor? Why don?t they ask why more than half the workers in the organised sector end up as ?insecure? or ?informal? labour? Why is the labour force participation rate of women so low and declining when neighbours like Bangladesh have registered an increasing trend? Why do the Dalits and Adivasis continue to be at the bottom of the ladder in every conceivable social and economic indicator of well-being? Why do regional, gender and other inequalities based on social identity keep increasing?

India requires planning that addresses social justice, reduces regional and gender inequalities, and ensures environmental sustainability.",,,
204,,"In line with the Government of India?s approach of less government and a move away from centralised planning, the NITI Aayog with a new structure and focus on policy willÿ>replace the 64-year old Planning Commissionÿthat was seen as a vestige of the socialist era. The new body, conceived more in the nature of a think-tank that will provide strategic and technical advice, will be helmed by the Prime Minister with a Governing Council of Chief Ministers and Lt. Governors, similar to the National Development Council that set the objectives for the Planning Commission. The NITI Aayog seeks substitute centralised planning with a ?bottom-up? approach where the body will support formulation of plans at the village level and aggregate them at higher levels of government. In short, the new body is envisaged to follow the norm of cooperative federalism, giving room to States to tailor schemes to suit their unique needs rather than be dictated to by the Centre. This is meant to be a recognition of the country?s diversity. The needs of a State such as Kerala with its highly developed social indicators may not be the same as that of, say, Jharkhand, which scores relatively low on this count. If indeed the body does function as has been envisaged now ? and the jury will be out on that ? States will, for the first time, have a say in setting their own development priorities. One significant change of note is that one of the functions of the body will be to address the needs of national security in economic strategy. Nowhere is this more relevant than in the area of energy security where India, unlike China, has failed to evolve a coherent policy over the years. Similarly, networking with other national and international think-tanks and with experts and practitioners, as has been envisaged, will add heft to the advice that the NITI Aayog will provide. To deflect criticism that this will be a free-market institution that ignores the deprived, the government has taken care to make the point that the body will pay special attention to the sections of society that may not benefit enough from economic progress. How this operates in practice will bear close watching. Interestingly, though it will not be formulating Central plans any more, the NITI Aayog will be vested with the responsibility of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of programmes. Thus, while the advisory and monitoring functions of the erstwhile Planning Commission have been retained in the new body, the executive function of framing Plans and allocating funds for Plan-assisted schemes has been taken away. But who will now be responsible for the critical function of allocating Plan funds? Hopefully, there will be greater clarity on this aspect in the days ahead.",,,
205,,"The first meeting of NITI Aayog?s Governing Council was held in February 2015. Thereafter, three Sub-Groups of Chief Ministers were constituted by the Prime Minister, one each on rationalization of centrally sponsored schemes, skill development, and Swacch Bharat, with NITI Aayog acting as the secretariat. During its first three months, it initiated the work relating to the Mid-Term Appraisal of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. All the three Sub-Groups of Chief Ministers submitted their reports during the year 2015?16. In the finalization of these reports, the officials of NITI Aayog seemed to have played their role more as agents of the Central Government than as technical advisers. This was evident from the fact that just a day after the presentation of the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, the Ministry of Finance issued a notification without taking on board most of its recommendations. The fate of the reports by the other two Sub-Groups seems to have been similar.
In the second year of its operation, a second meeting of the Governing Council was held, which emphasized the shift in focus from planning to policy to influence the decisions of the private as well as the public sectors. The conference also emphasized the need for greater interaction between the Centre and the States. In this context, it was suggested that NITI Aayog should act as a repository of best practices for States and provide them advocacy support in resolving matters pending with the Union Ministries.

The Aayog took up the pending cases of the State of Telangana with the Union Ministries concerned while requesting other States to make use of its intermediation. But in retrospect, this role was more recommendatory and most of its suggestions were not acted upon by the Union Ministries concerned.

The Aayog also held a conference in July 2017 with the States to discuss their role in transforming India. However, the actions taken on the suggestions made by the States are still not known.

It also published a number of papers on sectors like agriculture, health, education, skill development, managing urbanization, power, infrastructure, social justice, etc. In the area of policy advocacy, it prepared a draft bill on agricultural land leasing and one on regulatory reforms, and completed the appraisal of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan suggesting policy correction in a number of areas. Most of these areas are in the domain of States. During the year 2016?17, the Aayog included, under the label of ?notable initiatives?, the constitution of a Committee of Chief Ministers on Digital Payments and initiated the process to develop identified islands for maritime trade, shipping, and fisheries, all areas identified as priority by Central Government.

The Aayog prepared the first-ever indices measuring States? performance in health, education, and water management. It also discussed issues relating to the removal of distinction between Plan and non-Plan expenditure, and the attainment of targets set under Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with State officials. Further, it took up the formulation of a Fifteen-Year Vision document as well as a Seven-Year Strategy and a Three-Year Action Agenda to ensure implementation of the Vision. Of these, the Three-Year Action Agenda has already been released and placed in the public domain. There is no evidence that the States have participated in the preparation of this Vision.

The Aayog?s Annual Report gives a detailed account of its work during the year 2017?18. Of relevance to Union?State relations is the draft roadmap for the development of the Northeastern and Eastern States, which is laudable. There is a separate section devoted to cooperative federalism. The report highlights two key aspects, and these relate to the joint development of the national developmental agenda by the Centre and the States, and the advocacy of State perspectives with Central Ministries. It also lists a series of initiatives to ensure that ?States are equal partners in the policy-making and implementing process?. Among the items listed are the third meeting of the Governing Council, the National Conference of Chief Secretaries on drivers for transforming India, and several initiatives relating to agriculture.",,,
206,,"The major complaints of States in regard to the functioning of the Planning Commission remain unaddressed. The complaints have largely been on the perception that the Centre is encroaching upon the States? responsibilities; imposing its own priorities while funding; assuming, without basis, that governance in States is weak despite the Union?s own dismal record in administering Union Territories; taking credit for schemes that are jointly funded; and continuing to advocate a one-size-fits-all approach in administration. The Aayog has missed some opportunities to make a qualitative difference. The CSS had to be reformed in the light of the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission.

Though the Niti Aayog was involved in the process, the manner in which these schemes were modified shows that the effort was only to shift greater responsibility onto States in terms of financing. The reform does not in any manner reflect the qualitative change in the design and implementation of the Central schemes that was promised when the Planning Commission was wound up.

A second opportunity arose when the distinction between Plan and non-Plan was removed. At that point, the organization had an opportunity to insist on taking a sector-wise comprehensive view of capital and revenue expenditures. However, that has not been done.",,,
207,,"The easy stuff has been done. The Narendra Modi government has put out a press release to announce the formation of a Niti Aayog to replace the old Planning Commission. The signage outside Yojana Bhavan in New Delhi has changed. The website of the Planning Commission has been archived.

And now comes the hard part: what should the new institution do and how should it operate?

The Planning Commission was set up in 1950 when India had just become an independent republic. The threat of political fragmentation had not completely gone away; it was a mere three years after the bloody partition of the country. Central planning was as much a political project as it was an economic one. The early plans were drawn out when India was short of domestic savings and foreign exchange. The so-called ?two-gap models"" were common in the development economics of the time. The state was supposed to play the role of entrepreneur because it was assumed that private industry did not have the resources for large projects. Financial markets were shallow. The original focus of the Planning Commission was on resource allocation. It is no secret that the planning experiment was a failure after the first decade or so.

The India for which the Niti Aayog has been set up is a radically different country. The old assumptions about low domestic savings, foreign exchange constraints and shallow financial markets have withered away. The private sector has replaced the public sector as the main engine of investment many decades ago. The markets have a far greater role to play in mobilizing savings and channelling them towards productive investments. The Planning Commission stared irrelevance in the face, even though it did try to reinvent itself as a manager of social sector schemes. The Niti Aayog should not?and cannot?be a resource allocator. It will be better placed to be an adviser. What does that precisely mean? The new institution should identify the binding constraints on economic development on a national scale: infrastructure, energy, water, education, environment and food production, for example. It should then advise the political system what can be done to address these constraints over the long term. And it should not try to micro manage government social sector schemes, as the previous denizens of Yojana Bhavan were wont to do in a failed bid to keep their organization relevant.

The style of functioning has to change as well. The press release announcing the formation of the Niti Aayog mentions cooperative federalism, a term that can be either meaningful or vacuous, depending on what is made of it. The Planning Commission treated elected chief ministers as courtiers who had to fly to New Delhi to ask for funds. Compare that with the Finance Commission, that goes to state capitals for meetings rather than summoning chief ministers to New Delhi. Modi has said that he wants chief ministers to be his partners. This belief should be reflected in the way the Niti Aayog functions. But what beyond that? The new institution?which once again has no constitutional status?needs to work in tandem with constitutional institutions such as the Finance Commission and the Interstate Council if a new federal culture has to evolve.

The former decides how national tax collections should be shared with the states. The 14th Finance Commission under the chairmanship of Y.V. Reddy would do well to ask New Delhi to transfer money to states with no strings attached. The Interstate Council can be a deliberative body that sorts out the bargaining issues between states that are at different levels of development or have different economic structures. The Niti Aayog should plug into these discussions as an influential advisory body.

The Niti Aayog can be a successful innovation as long as such details are tackled. There is as yet no clarity on its purpose. We hope the Modi government clears the fog in the months ahead. The big danger would otherwise be that the Niti Aayog will become a Planning Commission by another name: outdated, imperious and meddlesome.",,,
208,,"About 180 years ago, in 1837, popular Danish author Hans Christian Andersen wrote the famous short story, The Emperor?s New Clothes. The story reminds us of the duties of advisers to the king, who are expected to present a clear picture to the king, and give fair and frank advice, without fear or favour. It is pertinent to revisit the story now when the Narendra Modi government is celebrating three years in office. One of the key decisions taken by the government on assumption of office was to dismantle the Planning Commission, and replace it with a new body, the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog. NITI Aayog was expected to act as the principal government think tank and adviser to the Prime Minister on key policy issues, which can really transform India. The Planning Commission was a non-legislative body, with significant powers to allocate finances to states, but marred by bureaucratic processes and devoid of fresh thinking. It failed to keep its ear to the ground, and did not take into account the divergent demands and capacities of states. The creation of NITI Aayog was expected to be a game changer, to infuse new vigour and rigour in the policy planning process, involve key stakeholders, and address the failures of the previous plan body. One anticipated that it would prioritize the challenges faced by the economy and hit the ground running to address them in a transformational manner.

During the last two-and-a-half years, NITI Aayog has worked on several agendas, such as the promotion of digital payments, reforms in agriculture, education and railways, helping states undertake social sector reforms. While all these issues were important, and the suggestions made by NITI Aayog critical, it appears that the institution?s agenda and priorities are being set by government diktat rather than an organic, independent thought process. Often, it risked acting as a government mouthpiece and failed to be the transformational catalyst that many, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wanted it to be. For instance, while recognizing the importance of competition, it walked with the government on promoting digital payments through select entities, and kept mum when government policies distorted competition. NITI Aayog is yet to institutionalize a checks and balances mechanism to caution the government about the claims it makes, and apprise policymakers of the ground realities. While there have been a few exceptions, like Bibek Debroy?s suggestion on taxing farmers? income, which challenged the government?s stand on the issue, such instances have been rare. NITI Aayog recently released a draft three-year action agenda, which is part of a 15-year vision and seven-year strategy document. Other documents have not been released in the public domain as yet. True to NITI Aayog?s diffused working approach, the action agenda covers a wide range of issues, including the fiscal framework, agriculture, industry, services, transport, digital connectivity, public private partnership, energy, science, technology, governance, taxation, competition, environment, forests and water.
Such a wide-ranging approach is not what one would expect when dealing with imminent challenges. For example, while covering pertinent issues and providing important recommendations such as ?Price Deficiency Payment"" to remove distortions in the existing minimum support price mechanism in the farm sector, there is limited clarity on how, by whom, and the timelines within which such suggestions would be implemented. The recommendations have no common binding theme, and there?s an absence of prioritization.

Rather than a document infusing fresh thinking, the action agenda appears more like a document collating several policy-related recommendations provided by experts and government-formulated committees over the years. It puts limited or negligible focus on implementation challenges, bureaucratic reforms and government-citizen interaction, which is core to several good ideas remaining on paper and being left unimplemented.",,,
209,,"Rather than focusing on policy-level recommendations, NITI Aayog would have done better had it dealt with implementation-related challenges. A clear action agenda on how policies should be implemented, the creation of a feedback loop, taking into account changes on the ground, and fixing accountability of babus, would have been welcome. In addition, it should have focused on process reforms. While many of its recommendations, such as the creation of coastal employment zones, are interesting, the costs of implementing such recommendations must be compared with expected benefits in the medium term. A comparison of the costs and benefits of different policy alternatives should be made mandatory before policy recommendations are made. ",,,
210,,"On September 25, 2014, the Indian government announced the ?Make in India? initiative to encourage manufacturing in India and galvanize the economy with dedicated investments in manufacturing and services. Immediately after the launch, investment commitments worth croresÿwere announced. In 2015, India emerged as the top destination for foreign direct investment, surpassing the U.S. and China. In line with the national programme, States too launched their own initiatives. Five years later, as we brace for another Union Budget, it would be appropriate to take stock of the much-hyped initiative as the economy in general, and the manufacturing sector in particular, is on a slippery slope. The ?Make in India? idea is not new. Factory production has a long history in the country. This initiative, however, set an ambitious goal of making India a global manufacturing hub. To achieve this goal, targets were identified and policies outlined. The three major objectives were: (a) to increase the manufacturing sector?s growth rate to 12-14% per annum in order to increase the sector?s share in the economy; (b) to create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022; and (c) to ensure that the manufacturing sector?s contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (revised to 2025) from the current 16%. The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital. Given that big-ticket projects for grand initiatives such as ?Make in India? have long gestation periods and lag effects, assessments of such initiatives can be premature. Also, governments often use the excuse of inheriting an economy riddled with macroeconomic problems, and demand more time to set things right. This is an argument that the current government invokes frequently. However, five years is a reasonable time period to assess the direction and magnitude of outcomes. As the policy changes were intended to usher growth in three key variables of the manufacturing sector ? investments, output, and employment growth ? an examination of these will help us gauge the success of the policy.

The last five years witnessed slow growth of investment in the economy. This is more so when we consider capital investments in the manufacturing sector. Gross fixed capital formation of the private sector, a measure of aggregate investment, declined to 28.6% of GDP in 2017-18 from 31.3% in 2013-14 (Economic Survey 2018-19). Interestingly, though the public sector?s share remained more or less the same during this period, the private sector?s share declined from 24.2% to 21.5%. Part of this problem can be attributed to the decline in the savings rate in the economy. Household savings have declined, while the private corporate sector?s savings have increased. Thus we find a scenario where the private sector?s savings have increased, but investments have decreased, despite policy measures to provide a good investment climate. With regard to output growth, we find that the monthly index of industrial production pertaining to manufacturing has registered double-digit growth rates only on two occasions during the period April 2012 to November 2019. In fact, data show that for a majority of the months, it was 3% or below and even negative for some months. Needless to say, negative growth implies contraction of the sector. Thus, we are clearly waiting for growth to arrive.

Regarding employment growth, we have witnessed questions being raised over the government?s delay in releasing data as well as its attempts to revise existing data collection mechanisms. The crux of the debate has been that employment, especially industrial employment, has not grown to keep pace with the rate of new entries into the labour market.

Thus on all three counts, ?Make in India? has failed. Accusing the previous governments of policy paralysis, the NDA government announced a slew of policies with catchy slogans. This has resulted in an era of never-ending scheme announcements. ?Make in India? is a good example of a continuous stream of ?scheme? announcements. The announcements had two major lacunae. First, the bulk of these schemes relied too much on foreign capital for investments and global markets for produce. This created an inbuilt uncertainty, as domestic production had to be planned according to the demand and supply conditions elsewhere. Second, policymakers neglected the third deficit in the economy, which is implementation. While economists worry mostly about budget and fiscal deficit, policy implementers need to take into account the implications of implementation deficit in their decisions. The result of such a policy oversight is evident in the large number of stalled projects in India. The spate of policy announcements without having the preparedness to implement them is ?policy casualness?. ?Make in India? has been plagued by a large number of under-prepared initiatives.

The question that begs an answer is, why did ?Make in India? fail? There are three reasons. First, it set out too ambitious growth rates for the manufacturing sector to achieve. An annual growth rate of 12-14% is well beyond the capacity of the industrial sector. Historically India has not achieved it and to expect to build capabilities for such a quantum jump is perhaps an enormous overestimation of the implementation capacity of the government. Second, the initiative brought in too many sectors into its fold. This led to a loss of policy focus. Further, it was seen as a policy devoid of any understanding of the comparative advantages of the domestic economy. Third, given the uncertainties of the global economy and ever-rising trade protectionism, the initiative was spectacularly ill-timed.

?Make in India? is a policy initiative with inbuilt inconsistencies. The bundle of contradictions unfold when we examine the incongruity of ?swadeshi? products being made with foreign capital. This has led to a scenario where there is a quantum jump in the ?ease of doing business? ranking, but investments are still to arrive. The economy needs much more than policy window dressing for increasing manufacturing activity. The government must realise that industrialisation cannot be kick-started by a series of bills in Parliament and hosting investors? meets.",,,
211,,"""Make in India"" was launched in September 2014. On his website (pmindia.gov.in), the prime minister explains that ""since years policy-makers have been debating how to give an impetus to manufacturing in India and make India a Global Manufacturing Hub. But it is Narendra Modi, who within a matter of months, launched the ?Make in India? campaign to facilitate investment, foster innovation, enhance skill development, protect intellectual property & build best in class manufacturing infrastructure.? Manufacturing is important because it is the only way through which low-income nations can transition to middle and then high-income ones. There is no other pathway that we know of for rural and agrarian economies to become developed nations except first through light manufacturing (garments mainly), then more complex assembly before moving to high technology. It is a fact that India does a bit of all of the above, but as the prime minister?s note indicates, the most important element is manufacturing.

In 2014, the share of manufacturing in India?s Gross Domestic Product was 15%. Last year, it fell to 14%. 'Make in India"" has failed and it has been over five years since it was put into place. To give a comparison of where India stands and what the failure means, let?s have a look at some other nations. China, which we like comparing ourselves to, has an economy more than 5 times the size of India?s. Manufacturing?s share of GDP is at 29% (double that of India?s) and has remained there in the period of 2014-2020. Vietnam is 16% and has gone up from 13% when we launched Make in India. Sri Lanka is at 16%. Thailand (27%), Indonesia (19%), Phillippines (19%), Malaysia (21%), Singapore (20%). In Europe, Germany is at 20%, which is not surprising because it has one of the world?s biggest automobile industries. This is the second stage of industrial development, after garments. In the same period as Make in India, Bangladesh?s share of manufacturing has risen from 16% to 18%. Bangladesh?s overall GDP is growing at 8% per year, much faster than India. And the surprising thing is that in this period, Bangladesh?s garments exports have gone to US$ 38 billion. India has fallen from $18 billion to $16 billion. Garments are important because large numbers of semi-skilled workers are employed and especially women. In the around 5,000 garments manufacturing units in Bangladesh, 85% of the employees are women. Even Vietnam exports more garments in dollar terms than India, which has long had a lead in this industry but has given it up in recent years.

Manufacturing is a full-time job with a fixed salary and therefore it is the sort of work that is preferred by people to part-time labour or making pakoras. Why has India failed at developing this? My response is that ""Make in India"" is not really a strategy, it is a logo and some words and that by itself is meaningless. Manufacturing comes to places where you have semi-skilled workers. The quality of education in China is many a time superior to India, as those of us who have been there and interacted with their workers know. It is more expensive to set up manufacturing in China because the cost of labour is higher. Despite that, China?s share of manufacturing has not fallen in the five years that ""Make in India"" has been promoted.

The prime minister says the goal is to make India a $5 trillion economy. That is in itself not really a goal. India?s GDP will eventually reach that figure sooner or later. The question to be asked is how soon can it get there and what can the government do to quicken the pace? Those are the only important and relevant points. Here it is unclear what the answer is.

Modi?s strategy to redesign India?s economy was ""Make in India"", but that has flopped. In fact, he doesn?t even refer to it as much any longer if I am not mistaken. All of the data on that website that the PM?s office runs refers only to data from 2014 and has not even been updated.

We need an acknowledgement that this strategy has failed and that we need to develop a new one unless we are fine with a further decline in manufacturing. I do not think that is an acceptable outcome whether or not one is an admirer of the prime minister.",,,
212,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s ?Make in India? initiative, to my mind, has been one of the most significant, structured and outcome-oriented policy initiatives by any Indian government in recent years. It was, unlike many similar initiatives in the past, well structured, properly thought through, had an identified set of priorities (originally 16 sectors, now grown to 25) and focussed on the key issue dogging all inbound foreign direct investments in India ? the ease (or rather, the lack of) doing business in India. It was also particularly well-timed. The programme itself was formally introduced on September 25, 2014, but Modi had outlined it a month earlier. In his first Independence Day speech on August 15, 2014, Modi said, ?I want to tell the people of the whole world: Come, make in India. Come and manufacture in India. We have skill, talent, discipline and the desire to do something. We want to give the world an opportunity that come make in India.? The timing was near perfect. The Chinese growth engine had started slowing. Besides, new trade-related tensions between the world?s two biggest economies ? the US and China ? were giving jitters to investors worldwide. They were looking for a safe hedge bet against potential turmoil in their key manufacturing base, China. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with a strong, pro-business image, had just burst on the scene, talking the talk that investors love to hear, and what?s more having the absolute electoral mandate to enable him to walk the talk as well, without the many pressures of ?coalition dharma? which his predecessor had to face.

The ?Make in India? initiative, when it took off, had ticked all the right boxes. The policy promised to clear the red tape that shrouded any potential inbound investor, create world-class infrastructure required by modern manufacturing industry, and bring in policies that helped foster a climate of innovation and, importantly, protect the intellectual property that resulted from such innovation, something that global investors had little faith in as far as China was concerned.

So, we had a plan, it was workable and it was well-timed. Investors, should, logically, have been beating a path to India to set up mega manufacturing plants to supply the world. But has the ?Make in India? programme achieved what it set out to do?

Five years down the line, the picture is a bit muddled. True, in FDI terms, India is among the world?s top destinations, garnering inflows of $49 billion in calendar 2019, according to UNCTAD. India now accounts for 85 per cent of all FDI coming into South Asia (but then our competitors in the region are Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan!).

But FDI statistics include inflows into the capital markets, which still continue to account for the lion?s share of capital flows. Statistics on specific, manufacturing sector FDI flows are a bit harder to come by. Manufacturing FDI was around $8 billion in 2018-19, accounting for less than a quarter of the total inflows.

E-commerce, which has nothing to do with either manufacturing or ?Make in India?, is one of the key sectors for FDI.

In some sectors in particular, ?Make in India? appears to be doing exceedingly well. There are over a 100 mobile phone manufacturers in India and market leader Samsung last year upped one of its largest manufacturing set-ups from China and moved it to Noida in Uttar Pradesh. Apple and Xiaomi are also invested seriously in Indian manufacturing capacity.",,,
213,,"But Judged from the yardstick of what it set out to achieve, ?Make in India? is at best still a work in progress. The key stated outcomes were to increase the share of the manufacturing sector to 25 per cent of GDP and to create a 100 million additional jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2022. Clearly, both have not happened, and going by the increasingly gloomy predictions for GDP growth, unlikely to happen by the target year. Manufacturing?s share of GDP, currently a shade under 15 per cent, is not likely to increase significantly over the next two years. And jobs ? particularly relatively better paid, stable, manufacturing jobs ? continue to be a chimera.

Why hasn?t ?Make in India? worked? To understand this, we need to understand why companies invest outside their home geographies. Looking at our companies is a good place to start. Last year, Indian companies invested nearly $12 billion as FDI in other countries, and India is now one of the top 20 origin countries for global FDI.

Why did they do it? Essentially, there are just three or four factors which drive corporates into significantly increasing their risk exposure by venturing into a foreign land. The first and biggest push factor is market access. If the rules are such that you cannot fully access a coveted market without investing in it, companies will invest. That is why Tata Steel bought Corus, for instance.

The second factor is acquiring technology. Again, this was a big factor in some of the big Indian FDIs in recent years ? Tata Steel wanted technology for special steels, Tata Motors bough Jaguar Land Rover for its world class technology and design capability, and so on.

The third factor is acquiring talent. In the IT space for instance, a push-pull combination of tougher visa rules and availability of high-end talent, and access-limiting restrictions, particularly for government orders, has led to Indian IT giants like TCS, Infosys et al creating some serious capacity in the US.

The final factor is securing raw material and inputs for your domestic business. That is why Adani and Tata have bought mineral and coal mines abroad and why ONGC is making investments in oil and gas resources.

We need to ensure that the same factors apply in reverse as well. We have to make market access tougher via a pure trade route; we need to ensure that Indian innovation attracts global investment (it?s already happening in the start-up space); we need to ensure that our talent does not migrate abroad but is headhunted at home; and we need to ensure that our precious natural resources are value-added at home.

Unless we tweak our policies to get these right, the ?Make in India? lion cannot hope to be the king of his own jungle.",,,
214,,"The Narendra Modi government?s flagship ?Make in India"" programme is not the first attempt to goose Indian manufacturing. It will not be the last, no matter who wins the 2019 elections. Scrying the entrails of past policy pushes is helpful. It throws up some constant truths. Import substitution hasn?t worked and is unlikely to do so. Industrial policies can introduce significant distortions. Policy decisions made in New Delhi often don?t survive the journey to manufacturing plants. A new working paper by Rajesh Raj S.N., Kunal Sen and Sabyasachi Kar, Unmaking ?Make in India"": Weak governance, good deals and their economic impact, provides interesting insights into that last point. Since its inception in 2003, the World Bank?s Doing Business report has been perhaps the most popular yardstick by which to measure the state-business relationship. Much was made of India?s jumping 30 ranks to 100th position in last year?s report. It is a laudable achievement as far as it goes, speaking to the Modi government?s attempts to clear up regulatory cholesterol and put new, effective systems in place. In 2015, however, Mary Hallward-Driemeier and Lant Pritchett had a subversive take on the impact of such policy action in their paper, How business is done in the developing world: deals versus rules. Looking at firm-level data from the World Bank?s enterprise surveys (ES)?as opposed to the Doing Business reports which survey lawyers, consultants, bureaucrats and so on?they found a vast gulf between de jure regulatory frameworks and de facto realities. Corruption and deal-making between the state and businesses meant that across the nations studied, a handful of companies could obtain clearances and permissions far faster than the law suggested, while other companies took far longer than prescribed.

Raj, Sen and Kar mine this perspective further, looking at 2013-14 ES data across Indian states. In line with Hallward-Driemeier and Pritchett, they find a substantial difference between the de jure number of days required for a business to get an operating license or construction permit, and the de facto reality. So far, as expected. In fact, in the majority of states, the mean and median de facto values are lower?sometimes substantially so?than the regulations suggest. Does this mean that governance mechanisms are particularly efficient in these states? Not quite. They find a wide variance in firms? within-state experiences. For instance, in Bihar, ?the 10th percentile set of firms reports obtaining an operating license in one day, while 90th percentile set of firms reports obtaining a license in 90 days."" This makes it clear that a company?s regulatory experience is a product of its deal-making ability, not of a neutral governance mechanism. Here is where it gets interesting: Raj, Sen and Kar also find that firms in states with weaker capacity and poorer governance, as defined by a handful of proxy measures, are able to secure better deals?and that in most states, good deals go to the least productive firms.

The implications for Indian industry and development are obvious and troubling. For firms, India?s administratively weakest states are the most tempting targets for regulatory capture that is likely to skew the inclusive, broad-based growth they need. The natural advantage large companies have over upstart competitors in securing sweetheart deals also means that competition?and the innovation and productivity growth that comes with it?are undercut. There is thus efficiency loss when it comes to business growth pushing broader economic growth and development. By enriching politicians and bureaucrats, such deal-making and regulatory capture also creates structural disincentives for improving state capacity. In the absence of such capacity, the value of politicians as middlemen who can help firms cut in line or secure public goods for citizens rises. This, in turn, enables more deal-making, perpetuating the cycle.

In The Republic Of Beliefs: A New Approach To Law And Economics, Kaushik Basu has written that the effectiveness of laws rests to a significant extent on the belief among citizens of a state?s ability to enforce them?that is, buying into a rational expectation of behaviour in accordance with the law. Visible regulatory capture and lack of state capacity make such belief hard to buy into. There is also another factor at play here. To a significant extent, caste and kin networks remain important vectors of social, economic and political activity. This is a reality that doesn?t always mesh easily with India?s regulatory and legal framework. These are fundamental problems that define the business-state relationship in India, and extend considerably beyond it. Plainly, improving the regulatory framework is no panacea. Breaking the cycle will take far deeper transformations.",,,
215,,"India?s next government is poised to inherit a troubled economy. Several indicators point to a reduction in demand, including for packaged consumer goods and two-wheelers which had earlier seen consistent growth. Conscientious policymakers have consequently begun to highlight that this lack of demand is a symptom of a deeper malaise?namely, lack of income growth for a majority of Indians. A vicious cycle like this can only be remedied by resuscitating economic activity wherever possible. As far as manufacturing is concerned, the ?Make in India"" programme has thus far been unsuccessful in catalysing such activity. A large thrust of ?Make in India"" has been on localizing mobile phone manufacturing. Trade metrics, however, paint a dismal picture. Broadly, mobile manufacturing entails two steps?the higher-value activity of making components and the lower-value assembly of these. Traders can import parts and assemble them locally, or import ready-to-use phones, depending on relative advantages under prevailing import duty regimes. While imports of fully-built mobile phones have reduced substantially over the last five years, imports of components has risen manifold. Specifically, imports of ready-to-use phones on which India imposes 20% duty have fallen 80% from ?47,439 crore in 2014-15 to ?9,592 crore in 2018-19 (until February). However, imports of mobile components rose by around 116% from ?47,011 crore in 2014-15 to ?1.02 trillion in 2018-19 (until February). It thus seems an ?Assemble in India"" paradigm has emerged that serves the interests of companies that only wish to make nominal investments in local supply chains for trading profits, and not for manufacturing value addition.Typically, assembly does not account for more than 5-6% of a smartphone?s value. Lack of local value addition is worrying not just because it militates against the logic of ?Make in India"", but because it?s directly related to lack of income growth in India?s economy.

A sharp contraction in exports of mobile phones from India worsens the outlined challenges. Mobile phone exports peaked in 2012-13 at ?14,487 crore. By 2018-19, they had fallen to under ?9,000 crore. That is, imported parts were not used to make complete products for re-export. Instead, these component imports fuelled a trading and assembly ecosystem which contributes very little value locally. Indian consumption demand, then, is not doing much to drive domestic income growth. Evidently, ?Make in India"" has been limited in ambition and scope. Its vision follows from an outsize focus on erecting tariff barriers to protect domestic industry, instead of incentivizing manufacturing competitiveness through tax breaks, infrastructural support and other structural interventions. A similar tariff-led approach failed to catalyse the local manufacture of solar cells, the technologies of which have evolved rapidly like phone technologies. Keeping up with the technology curve requires serious investments in local research and development, which high-tariff regimes do not encourage.

India?s tariff-led approach is reminiscent of a bygone era of industrial policies. However, greater specialization of industrial production today means that countries must adopt holistic policies that address supply chain complexities. Instead, in 2016, India chose to adopt a simplistic Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) under ?Make in India"", to levy duties on component imports hoping to stem related merchandise inflows. The PMP is a sequential application of tariffs that are raised gradually for different mobile phone components. Lower-value parts such as battery packs and chargers are sought to be localized first, followed by higher-value components like display screens and cameras. However, the disadvantages of manufacturing in India, including acute infrastructural deficits, cannot be offset by high tariffs alone. This is already visible in import statistics relating to low-value components covered under the PMP?s first phase. More such components are being imported at cheaper rates, perhaps an indication of the large surplus capacity of Chinese companies, which dominate the Indian smartphone market.

It could be argued that Chinese companies cannot similarly reduce costs on higher-value components. However, both the European Union and Japan have recently filed consultation requests at the World Trade Organization on the tariffs imposed by India on several ICT products, including ready-to-use phones and several assembly components covered under the PMP. Such consultations constitute the first step towards initiation of disputes at the WTO. Given that India had already committed to keeping its tariff levels at zero on such products prior to the notification of PMP, the programme may have a short shelf life. It is also worth highlighting the strategic opportunity India currently enjoys, wherein it can leverage the ongoing trade spat between the US and China to attract firms that may be looking to hedge bets and shift some manufacturing capacity out of China. However, lacklustre inward investment in manufacturing shows that such re-orientation is contingent on a re-balancing of incentives and tariffs under ?Make in India"". The next government could begin to address such concerns with an immediate impact assessment of the PMP, particularly since the success of ?Make in India"" and income growth in the economy are correlated.",,,
216,,"On his website (pmindia.gov.in), the Prime Minister explains, ?since years policy-makers have been debating how to give an impetus to manufacturing in India and make India a Global Manufacturing Hub. But it is Narendra Modi, who within a matter of months, launched the ?Make in India? campaign to facilitate investment, foster innovation, enhance skill development, protect intellectual property & build best in class manufacturing infrastructure.? Manufacturing is important because it is the only way in which low income nations can transition to middle and then high-income ones. There is no other pathway that we know of for rural and agrarian economies to become developed nations except first through light manufacturing (garments mainly), then more complex assembly before moving to high technology. It is a fact that India does a bit of all of the above, but as the Prime Minister?s note indicates, the most important element is manufacturing.


In 2014, the share of manufacturing in India?s Gross Domestic Product was 15%. Last year it fell to 14%.

Make in India has failed and it has been over five years since it was put into place.

To give a comparison of where India stands and what the failure means, let?s have a look at some other nations. China, which we like comparing ourselves to has an economy which is more than five times the size of India?s. Manufacturing?s share in China?s GDP is at 29% (double that of India?s) and has remained there in the period of 2014-2020. Vietnam is 16% and has gone up from 13% when we launched Make in India. Sri Lanka is at 16%. Thailand (27%), Indonesia (19%), Phillippines (19%), Malaysia (21%), even Singapore (20%) has a more dominant manufacturing sector. In Europe, Germany is at 20%, which is not surprising because it has one of the world?s biggest automobile industries. This is the second stage of industrial development, after garments.

In the same period as Make in India, Bangladesh?s share of manufacturing has risen from 16% to 18%.

Bangladesh?s GDP overall is growing at 8% per year, much faster than India. And the surprising thing is that in this period Bangladesh?s garments exports have gone up to US$ 38 billion. India has fallen from $18 billion to $16 billion.

Garments are important because large numbers of semi-skilled workers are employed and especially women. In the around 5,000 garments manufacturing units in Bangladesh, 85% of the employees are women.

Even Vietnam exports more garments in dollar terms than India, which has long had a lead in this industry but has given it up in recent years.

Manufacturing is a full-time job with a fixed salary and therefore it is the sort of work that is preferred by people to part time labour or making pakoras. Why has India failed at developing this? My response is that Make in India is not really a strategy, it is a logo and some words and that by itself is meaningless. Manufacturing comes to places where you have semi-skilled workers. The quality of education in China is many times superior to India, as those of us who have been there and interacted with their workers know. It is more expensive to set up manufacturing in China because the cost of labour is higher. But despite that China?s share of manufacturing has not fallen in the five years that Make in India has been promoted.

The Prime Minister says that the goal is to make India a $5 trillion economy. That is in itself not really a goal.

India?s GDP will eventually reach that figure sooner or later. The question to be asked is how soon can it get there and what can the government do to quicken the pace? Those are the only important and relevant points.

Here it is unclear what the answer is.

Modi?s strategy to redesign India?s economy was Make in India, but that has flopped. In fact, he doesn?t even refer to it as much any longer, if I am not mistaken. All of the data on that website that the PM?s office runs https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/major_initiatives/make-in-india/ refers only to data from 2014 and has not even been updated.

We need an acknowledgement that this strategy has failed and that we need to develop a new one, unless we are fine with further decline in manufacturing.

I do not think that is an acceptable outcome whether or not one is an admirer of the Prime Minister.",,,

218,,"The Global Innovation Index, brought out by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, in association with Cornell University and Instead, offers an opportunity to assess how a country compares with its peers. India can cheer that it has moved up four positions and is now placed 48th, within the top 50, out of 131. China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Japan are ahead of India in Asia. No surprise. But so are Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. With the world?s largest cohort of young people of college-going age, who can be trained in science, engineering, technology, Maths and the creative arts, India can and should be among world leaders in innovation. But how to reach there? Switzerland is at the top of the index. It is not a leading country in venture capital spending. The US and China spend far more, per capita. That is the whole point: innovation is not a mechanical result of spending more. The way the index is constructed is as an average of innovation inputs and innovation outputs. Inputs are institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, and business sophistication. Innovation outputs are: knowledge and technology outputs and creative outputs. Presumably many entrepreneurs in the US had access to the different technologies ? basic telecom, touchscreen, LCD display panels, ability to develop applications ? that Steve Jobs put together to launch the iPhone, but it took some entrepreneurial genius to do what he did. Without the technology, the fruit of sustained investment in R&D, the phone would not have been possible. Without an eye for design, aesthetics and consumer needs, the phone could not have been designed as it came out. Without the business acumen to create an App Store that Apple controlled completely, the phone could not have become a steady stream of income beyond the sale proceeds of the phone.

Beyond R&D, the ability to think big and think bold, venture capital that backs entrepreneurial vision and a regulatory and operating ecosystem that lets people focus on business are imperative for innovation.",,,
219,,"Prime MinisterÿNarendra Modiÿlaunched the Make in India campaign on September 25, 2014 with these words: ?I tell the world, ?Make in India?. Sell anywhere but manufacture here.? Modi aspired to emulate China ? a country he had visited many times as Gujarat chief minister ? in attracting foreign investment to industrialise India. The objective was, officially, to increase the manufacturing sector?s growth rate to 12-14 per cent per annum in order to increase this sector?s share in the economy from 16 to 25 per cent of the GDP by 2022 ? and to create 100 million additional jobs by then. Five years later, this policy has produced contrasting results. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has increased from $16 billion in 2013-14 to $36 billion in 2015-16. But this remarkable achievement needs to be qualified from two standpoints. First, FDIs have plateaued since 2016 and second, they are not contributing to India?s industrialisation. FDIs in the manufacturing sector, in fact, are on the wane. In 2017-18, they were just above $7 billion , as against $9.6 billion in 2014-15. Services cornered most of the FDIs ? $23.5 billion, more than three times that of the manufacturing sector. This is a clear reflection of the the Indian economy?s traditional strong points, where computer services, for instance, are remarkably developed. But can a country rely on services without developing an industrial base? The response is clearly no and this is why ?Make in India? was initiated.

The idea, then, was to promote export-led growth: Foreign investors were invited to make in India, not necessarily for India. But few investors have been attracted by this prospect, and India?s share in the global exports of manufactured products remains around 2 per cent ? China?s is around 18 per cent. Why has Make in India failed to deliver? First, a large fraction of the Indian FDI is neither foreign nor direct but comes from Mauritius-based shell companies. Indian tax authorities suspected that most of these investments were ?black money? from India, which was routed via Mauritius. Second, the productivity of Indian factories is low. According to a McKinsey report, ?workers in India?s manufacturing sector are almost four and five times less productive, on average, than their counterparts in Thailand and China?. This is not just because of insufficient skills, but also because the size of the industrial units is too small for attaining economies of scale, investing in modern equipment and developing supply chains. Why are companies small? Partly by choice, because labour regulations are more complicated for plants with more than 100 employees. Government approval is required under the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 before laying off any employee and the Contract Labour Act of 1970 requires government and employee approval for simple changes in an employee?s job description or duties.

Infrastructure is also a problem area. Although electricity costs are about the same in India and China, power outages are much higher in India. Moreover, transportation takes much more time in India. According to Google Maps, it takes about 12.5 hours to travel the 1,213 km distance between Beijing to Shanghai. A Delhi to Mumbai trip of 1,414 km, via National Highway 48, in contrast, takes about 22 hours. Average speeds in China are about 100 km per hour, while in India, they are about 60 km per hour. Railways in India have saturated while Indian ports have constantly been outperformed by many Asian countries. The 2016 World Bank?s Global Performance Index ranked India 35th among 160 countries. Singapore was ranked fifth, China 25th and Malaysia 32nd. The average ship turnaround time in Singapore was less than a day; in India, it was 2.04 days.

Bureaucratic procedures and corruption continue to make India less attractive for investors. It has made progress in the World Bank?s Ease of Doing Business index, but even then, is ranked 77 among 190 countries. India ranks 78 out of 180 countries in Transparency International?s Corruption Perception Index. To acquire land to build a plant, for instance, remains difficult. India has slipped 10 places in the latest annual Global Competitiveness Index compiled by Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF).

There was clearly a contradiction in the attempt to attract foreign investors to Make in India before completing the reforms of labour and land acquisition laws. Liberalisation is not the panacea for all that ails the economy, but it is a prerequisite if India intends to follow an export-oriented growth pattern.

A significant move in this direction was made last month with the reduction of the company tax from about 35 to about 25 per cent (at least on paper), a rate comparable with most of India?s neighbours. This reform is also consistent with the government?s effort to compete with South East Asian countries, in particular, to attract FDIs. This competition has acquired a new dimension in the context of the US-China trade dispute. After the Trump administration increases tariffs on Chinese exports to the US, several companies will shift their plants from China to other Asian countries. Some of them have already done so. According to the Japanese financial firm Nomura, only three of the 56 companies that decided to relocate from China moved to India. Of them, Foxconn is a major player which will be now assembling its top-end iPhones in India. Whether other big multinationals will begin to show interest at manufacturing in India remains to be seen.

But India will have to face another external challenge too as it sees capital fleeing the country. The net outflow of capital has jumped as the rupee has dropped from 54 a dollar in 2013 to more than 70 to a dollar in 2019, at a time when oil is becoming more expensive.",,,
220,,"There is now a plethora of evidence that the economy has been cooling down over the last three years. Official data was slow to pick up the trend, but data from private sources on indicators such as sales of consumer durables and automobiles clearly show that it is largely a result of declining demand, particularly in rural areas. The Union budget presented on 5 July was expected to address some of these concerns. However, it was a missed opportunity, with no effort being made to increase spending in rural areas, except for the electoral promise of cash transfer to farmers. Also disappointing was the government?s approach in dealing with most rural development programmes. These not only directly contribute to creating rural infrastructure and assets, but also indirectly help increase rural demand and employment. For most of these programmes, the budget expenditure was kept constant or lowered. Of particular importance is the all-India scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Its budget allocation has fallen compared to the revised expenditure of last year, and is insufficient, given the wage-payment arrears.

The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) showed apathy towards the rural and agricultural sectors during its first term in government, and in many ways is continuing the flawed policies of the second term of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The UPA, which enacted MGNREGA and reaped political dividends for its successful rollout during its first term, contributed to the weakening of the programme as well as the changing of its basic character. The government kept the budget allocation low and created administrative bottlenecks that stifled the programme. This trend has continued under the NDA. This alliance also altered the basic character of the scheme. MGNREGA was envisaged as a provider of rural employment to casual workers at government-mandated minimum wages set above market wages. This was the case at its 2006 launch. The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) has been tracking wages received by casual workers employed under MGNREGA and private markets since 2007-08, when it introduced a separate category for MGNREGA work. This has been retained even in the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the report of which was released recently. In 2007-08, the second year of MGNREGA implementation, wages under the programme were 5% higher than market wages for rural male workers and 58% higher for rural female workers. This was one of the reasons that the programme attracted almost 50% female workers, in contrast to the trend of declining female workforce participation since 2004-05. By 2009-10, MGNREGA wages were only 90% of market wages for males, but 26% higher than market wages for females. By 2011-12, they were lower than market wages for both category of workers, but for females, they were close to market levels. The 2017-18 PLFS estimates show that private market wages for males were higher than MGNREGA wages by 74%, and female market wages were higher than MGNREGA wages by 21%. Clearly, no male worker is going to demand MGNREGA work when he can get a much higher daily wage with the same effort . However, women continue to demand and work under MGNREGA, though market wages are higher, because of non-availability of work and discrimination as well as exclusion from the private labour market. A peculiar result of this is the overwhelming participation of women in MGNREGA in southern states, where casual wages are higher in general, with Kerala reporting only female workers. However, many states, including Gujarat, did not report any MGNREGA work in 2017-18. Keeping MGNREGA wages significantly lower than market wages is a deliberate attempt to finish the programme. MGNREGA wages are less than half of the national minimum wage of ?375 per day (as on July 2018) proposed by an expert group. Even the Economic Survey presented on 4 July has a chapter on minimum wages, which argues in favour of keeping minimum wages at a sufficiently high level to reduce poverty and inequality.

At a time when the government is pushing for a minimum wage code, the largest government-run programme has been violating state minimum wages for almost a decade.

MGNREGA could have been the lifeline to revive the rural economy, which is in distress. However, the political slugfest and flawed policies of the government have led to a situation where MGNREGA, bereft of its original character, is unable to provide a stimulus to the rural economy, despite the strong evidence of it having pushed up rural wages and incomes during the first five years of its implementation. It also created rural infrastructure and provided much-needed employment to the country?s rural population. On 27 February 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Parliament that he would like MGNREGA to be a monument of failure, though he would not finish the programme for political reasons. This objective has been achieved, with the trend having started under the UPA-II regime.",,,
221,,"The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has been described by the World Bank as the largest antipoverty state-run employment-generation scheme in the world. It formed the cornerstone of the shift in the UPA?s approach to development towards universalisation and entitlements, articulated in the National Common Minimum Programme. The idea of an employment guarantee was also central to theÿCongress?s agenda in its 2004 election manifesto. The BJP?s ascendance post-2014 raised several questions over the continuation of MGNREGA, especially in light of its welfare narrative distinguished from that of the Congress by way of its focus on ?empowerment?, as opposed to a ?rights? and ?entitlements? focused agenda. Despite the BJP?s ideological differences with the Congress over the approach to employment generation, it has made the highest-ever budgetary allocations to MGNREGA, with `550 billion allocated to the scheme for FY19, up from `480 billion in the previous year. The preceding three years witnessed the NDA increase budgetary allocation towards it.

Even though the UPA was led by the Congress, a left-of-centre political party, a key factor in ensuring that the NREGA, when passed in 2005, was not watered-down to adhere to neoliberal conceptions of social policy was the dependence of the UPA on Left Front parties. After 2004 elections, the UPA would not have secured the numbers to form a government without the support of parties like the CPI(M). Left Front parties enjoyed disproportionate policy influence in such a set-up until their decision to withdraw support from the UPA.

This influence was exercised by way of interventions played out through the UPA-Left Coordination Committee negotiations, a party political process. Moreover, UPA alliance partners like the RJD brought political leaders to the Centre like rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, who played the crucial role of a bridge between the fiscal conservatives and populists in the UPA.

MGNREGA was the flagship scheme among the many policy initiatives of the first term of the UPA. Its success and impact on rural India is believed to have carried the UPA to another term at the Centre. However, as the second term of the UPA (2009-14) became increasingly mired in corruption scandals, the existing issues in MGNREGA?s implementation with states failing to provide employment, delaying and withholding wages, and corruption occurring due to a lack of proper social auditing and monitoring, were exacerbated by the UPA?s overall image of policy paralysis and inaction.

According to Ashok Pankaj, upon ?reaching full acceleration in 2009-10 and 2010-11, (MGNREGS) decelerated in 2011-12 while the UPA was dilly-dallying with the idea of a cash transfer-based social protection programmes, aiming at 2014 parliamentary elections?, and the shift in attention from MGNREGA to DBT is partly to blame for the slack implementation of the scheme during 2011-14. Systematically cutting funding for MGNREGA began in 2010, by way of caps on allocated funds, causing administrative failures like problems with wage payment and provision of employment. Its impact on the employment generated through the scheme was that the number of households that got jobs increased by 89.5% over a decade. But the number peaked at 5.49 crore in 2011 and has since declined steadily.

The right-wing BJP-led NDA came to power in 2014, with Narendra Modi as PM. The BJP commanded a majority in the Lok Sabha by itself, and was thus less beholden to coalition partners in formulating its policies. It also placed technology at the heart of its policy agenda, onboarding the UPA?s DBT approach early on through its Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity, with a view to migrating towards a cash-based welfare setup. Some believe this unfortunately glosses over the roots of governance delivery failures like complex procedures, weak human resources and poor training.

While proposals to scale back MGNREGA had been discussed during the first year of Modi government, in light of its pro-business and investment-oriented approach?hinged on a narrative of ?empowerment?, exemplified by Make in India, Skill India, and Start-up India, etc?as opposed to the ?entitlements? and ?rights?-oriented framework of the Congress, the NDA has made increasingly higher budgetary allocations to MGNREGA, with the figure for FY19 being the highest allocation till date, and has simultaneously not abandoned the programme.

But these allocations have followed the BJP learning from the adverse political consequences of initially attempting to strangulate MGNREGA through pointedly low allocations in the NDA?s first two years. At the same time, the NDA has altered the focus of MGNREGA towards emphasising on top-down, target-driven, asset-creation, which is the polar opposite of the UPA?s demand-driven job-creation regime focused on participatory decentralised development.

Ashok Pankaj argues there has been a sharp distinction in the nature of the programme pursued by the UPA and the NDA, which he describes as ?wage-focused? against ?asset-focused?, and ?target-focused? at the cost of ?demand-focused?, compromising the objective of participatory decentralised development.

But this ?asset fetishism?, while not entirely undesirable, has nevertheless tilted the benefits of MGNREGA in favour of agriculturists, excluding landless rural labourer households that constitute a quarter of India?s rural population from accessing benefits of individual assets owing to their lack of land, and affecting job-creation.

The UPA had prioritised job-creation over asset-creation by mandating a wage-material expenditure ratio of 60:40 in the Act, which also mandated that four out of the eight works are to be labour-intensive.

Only a weak relationship exists between ?political will? and the implementation of a scheme, especially in Indian context, since there is a lack of a one-to-one mapping between economic and social ideologies on either side of the political spectrum in India. While lying on two opposite ends of the political spectrum, the Congress and the BJP have followed broadly the same paths in the pursuit of neoliberal policy.

With Modi lending no personal ideological support to MGNREGA, the BJP has been forced to retain the scheme for fear of losing electoral support in rural India. The enhanced outlays, and mere tweaking the programme?s attributes to justify its own ideological underpinnings, prove that political will cannot be seen as an important determinant of the implementation of MGNREGA in the case of the BJP.",,,
222,,"A record 4.89 crore persons belonging to 3.44 crore households sought work under theÿMahatma GandhiÿNational Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in May. This is against 3.18 crore persons from 2.26 crore households for the same month last year, when large parts of India were experiencing drought-like conditions. The current surge in MGNREGA work demand reflects a drought, not of water, but of jobs and incomes. And it seems to be coming mainly from migrant workers returning to their villages from cities and industrial centres post the COVID lockdown. Proof of it is the states where the number of households registering demand has shown the highest increase: Uttar Pradesh (299.3 per cent in May 2020 over May 2019), West Bengal (214.5 per cent), Odisha (113.5 per cent), Chhattisgarh (68.9 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (65.1 per cent) and Bihar (62.1 per cent). These are all labour exporting states. What?s now being seen is an extraordinary phenomenon of distress reverse migration from city to village. The lockdown hasn?t hit the rural economy, more so agriculture, that badly. The MGNREGA has been generally viewed as a scheme that provides employment during the lean period for agriculture, thereby reducing seasonal labour migration from rural to urban areas. The demand for work, too, typically peaks in May-June before falling in the subsequent months coinciding with the main kharif cropping season. But this conventional pattern may not hold in the present scenario, where the primary demand driver will not be the landless agricultural labourer who would have little work after the kharif or rabi crop has been harvested. If the laid-off auto worker from Gurgaon-Manesar or erstwhile hotel employee in Mumbai is the one seeking employment under MGNREGA ? and there is no way to gainfully engage them in agriculture ? the scheme?s scope will have to be widened. To start with, the number of days of guaranteed employment to adult members of any rural household needs to be expanded beyond the existing 100 days. The returning migrant workers may, at some point, want to go back to jobs that paid better. But those jobs aren?t going to come back soon either.

This is where a rethink on the MGNREGA?s basic design might be called for without compromising its objective. If the idea is to provide work to anybody demanding it, there should, in principle, be no restrictions on the kind of activities allowed under the scheme. The stipulation of a 60:40 wage-to-material cost ratio can also be relaxed. If higher material component helps in building more assets with durable quality, why cannot these projects qualify under the MGNREGA? Why tie it down to particular ?permitted works?? What stops MGNREGA labour from being used even to undertake railway or national highway work? Any public work ultimately requires labour and so long as it is given on demand, the MGNREGA has fulfilled its purpose.",,,
223,,"Despite an acute funds crunch faced by the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme, the budgetary allocation for the 2020-2021 financial year (FY) has only been increased marginally, from Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 61,500 crore. This increase, however, when compared with the revised estimate of FY 2019-20, is actually 9.1% less. In 2019-20, the revised estimate was Rs 71,002 crore. For the last few years, rural distress has been visible across India. There has been a sharp rise in the number of people dependent on the rural employment scheme for their sustenance. The Centre, right now, is on the verge of running out of funds to run the scheme.

According to the scheme?s financial statement released last week, as many as 15 states are in the red. According to a report in The Hindu, more than 96% of the allocated money has already been spent or is needed to pay pending dues. Less than Rs 2,500 crore is left to sustain the scheme for the next two months, the report says.

The scheme has to still run on the earlier allocation until March end and the newly announced budgetary allocation will be available only from April 1.

According to the NREGA Sangarsha Morcha, a national platform of workers? collectives, trade unions, organisations and individuals, an allocation of a minimum Rs 1 lakh crore is required to ensure a smooth running of the scheme. Explaining the breakdown of the figures and the rationale behind the estimate given by the organisation, NREGA Sangarsha Morcha, in its press note released on January 31, says with a projected labour at 270 crore person and considering Rs. 248 is paid per person per day on an average, an estimated Rs 66,960 crores would be needed to only pay wages. Among other expenditures, there are material components, which the organisation has studied to be around Rs 16,740 crores.

In the last five years, the organisation says nearly one-sixth of each year?s allocation have been pending wage liabilities. ?Assuming that the pending wages would be the same proportion going in to FY 2020-21, the component of pending wage liabilities is 79,515/6, which account to about Rs 13,252 crores.? The total expenditure of Rs 92,767 crore and an additional average 10% inflation would amount to about Rs 1,20,050 crore.

Taking the budgetary distributions and the supplementary allocation of funds to the programme for the last few years into account, it can be deduced that though the demand for employment under the scheme has been on a steady rise in the past years, the government has failed to address it fully. This has only added to the pending liabilities.

In its press statement, Peoples Action for Employment Guarantee, a civil society collective has said, ?All eyes were on the Union Budget 2020-21 to see how the Central Government would leverage its only legislative mechanism to provide employment and alleviate rural distress i.e. the MGNREGA. And the result has been worse than expected, and deeply distressing.? The statement further points to the BJP government?s decision to reduce the budgetary allocation of MGNREGA by Rs 9,500 crore from its revised estimate of 2019-20. ?The reduction in the budgetary allocation is taking place when the minimum allocation needed to protect the MGNREGA as status quo is nearly Rs 85,927 crore.? Responding to the budget, James Herenj of the Jharkhand NREGA Watch, a civil society initiative floated to ensure efficient implementation of the scheme said, ?The budget has not taken the dire requirement of the scheme into consideration. In Jharkhand alone, of the total 26 lakh labourers with active job cards, only about 20 thousand labourers have got 100 days job. This situation will only worsen in the coming years,? Herenj says. In 2019-20, Herenj said Jharkhand could only ensure an average of 35 days work and around Rs. 83 crores are pending to be paid in wages. ?Almost all of those dependent on jobs under the MGNREGA are from Bahujan communities. Like, in Jharkhand, 41% belong to the Scheduled Tribes (ST) and the Scheduled Castes (SC) and the rest are from Other Backward Classes (OBC). This would be the case more or less in every state,? Herenj added.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman took over two hours and forty minutes, the longest speech in 17 years, to present the budget. But the annual outlay for the MGNREGA ? the only government programme providing direct employment ? was not a part of her speech. Herenj says this pretty much sums up the government?s intention and interest to run the scheme.",,,
224,,"The Goods and Services Tax regime completed three years on July 1. The concept of GST came in 2005 when the Vijay Kelkar-led task force submitted its report and recommended the replacement of all indirect taxes with GST. Even earlier, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha constituted a seven-member Expert Group on Taxation of Services as per his budget speech for FY2000-01. The expert group led by M Govinda Rao submitted its report in March 2001. The group made the first recommendation on GST. The dream became a reality when the new tax was introduced at the midnight of June 30 and July 1, 2017. It was introduced as the biggest tax reform for indirect taxes. But unfortunately, it has failed to live up to people?s expectations. To remove glitches, the government has made 697 changes in GST since its inception by issuing notifications related to rates, the amendment of rules and waiver of penalty. Besides this, 146 circulars and 19 orders have been issued so far on various issues.

It was expected that the introduction of GST would increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country because a simplified tax structure will eliminate the cascading effect of taxes and increase government?s revenue. While there may be a set of complex factors that have led to a dip in growth, the fact is that the expected boost has not happened. The growth rate of GDP of Q4 of FY20 has declined to 3.1%. The growth rate of GDP for FY20 has fallen to 4.2% ? the lowest in the last 11 years. The coding of goods under various Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN) brackets has always been a challenge for the GST council. Take this example. In the recent past, the Authority for Advanced Rulings (AAR)-Karnataka bench has said that 18% GST will be levied on parathas and roti will be taxed at 5% of GST slabs rate. The AAR has ruled that a paratha is different from a roti. The same problem arose with the rate of tax on hand sanitiser. The AAR-Goa bench established that alcohol-based hand sanitisers will be taxed at 18%. Hand sanitisers are essential in the Covid-19 battle. While the GST Council has made efforts to resolve such issues, the fact that they keep recurring is a sign of the weakness of the system. Various states were ready to hop on to the same boat on the condition that the central government would compensate their revenue loss for the first five years. Accordingly, a provision was made under section 7 of GST (Compensation to State) Act, 2017. As per the provision, the loss of revenue will be compensated at the end of every two months for five years. When states were fighting against the pandemic and struggling for revenue in the middle of the lockdown, the Centre did not release compensation money, which had not been paid since November 2019. The Centre only released Rs 36,400 crore on June 4, due to the states and Union territories for the period starting from December 2019 to February 2020. The government further released Rs 13,806 crore for March 2020 on July 27, and paid all dues for FY20. The amount for April-July for FY21 is still due. While states need the compensation, the Centre seems to lack the resources to meet its commitment on a consistent basis.

On the revenue front, there was an unofficial target to collect Rs 1 lakh crore GST every month. The average collection was Rs 89,885 crore in FY18, Rs 98,114 crore in FY19, though this improved to Rs 101,845 crore in FY20. The total revenue collection was Rs 7.19 lakh crore in the first eight months of FY18. The total revenue collection was Rs 11.77 lakh crore in FY19 and Rs 12.22 lakh crore in FY20.

There was no budget provision made by the central government for FY18. The revised estimate was made of Rs 4.44 lakh crore. But the actual realisation was Rs 4.42 lakh crore. The government had made a budget provision of Rs 7.43 lakh crore for FY19. The target was revised downward to Rs 6.43 lakh crore in the midterm budget review for FY19. However, the actual realisation was Rs 5.81 lakh crore. The government has made a budgeted estimate of Rs 7.61 lakh crore for the collection of GST for FY20 in the interim budget. However, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman?s revised budget estimates to Rs 6.63 lakh crores in her maiden budget speech for FY20. The target was further revised to Rs 6.12 lakh crore. All these figures show a consistent overestimation of the collections. The government has already set a budgeted target of Rs 6.90 lakh crore for FY21. The collection for the first four months for FY21 is Rs 32,172 crore, Rs 62,151 crore, Rs 90,917 crore and Rs 87,422 crore respectively. The signs are clear. There will be a shortfall again, making the reality of GST more sobering than the promise of GST.",,,
225,,"Three years ago, the Centre and the States of the Union of India struck a grand bargain resulting in theÿlaunch of the unified Goods and Services Tax (GST) era. The States gave up their right to collect sales tax and sundry taxes, and the Centre gave up excise and services tax. The nationwide GST promised frictionless commerce across State borders,buoyant and leakproof tax compliance, and removal of inefficiencies like the cascade of ?tax on tax?. This historic grand bargain was the result of painstaking consensus building, whichÿinter aliaÿinvolved addressing the apprehension of States, of revenue loss due to the GST. Their consent was secured by a promise of reimbursing any shortfall in tax revenues for a period of five years. This reimbursement was to be funded by a special cess called the GST compensation cess. The promised reimbursement was to fill the gap for an assured 14% year on year tax growth for five years, and it was generous to a fault. Neither the national aggregate nor any of the major States had this record for the previous five years. But that was not the only fault with the design, which had also failed to learn from the successful design of harmonising Value Added Tax (VAT) rates across the nation, implemented just a decade ago. VAT was the precursor to GST and also needed a consensus. That design too had an inbuilt reimbursement formula. But that tapered over the years, making room for incentives for tax effort from the States, sort of ?skin in the game?. As the economy battles a pandemic and recession, the tax collection has dropped significantly, while expenditure needs are sharply higher, especially at the frontline of the battle, at the State level. But it seems that the States have been told that they are on their own to meet the shortfall in revenues. Using an equivalent of the Force Majeure clause in commercial contracts, the Centre is abdicating its responsibility of making up for the shortfall in 14% growth in GST revenues to the states. This is wrong on many counts. First, the States do not have recourse to multiple options that the Centre has, such as issue of a sovereign bond (in dollars or rupees) or a loan against public sector unit shares from the Reserve Bank of India. Second, the Centre can anyway command much lower rates of borrowing from the markets as compared to the States. Third, in terms of aggregate public sector borrowing, it does not matter for the debt markets, nor the rating agencies, whether it is the States or the Centre that is increasing their indebtedness. Fourth, fighting this recession through increased fiscal stimulus is basically the job of macroeconomic stabilisation, which is the Centre?s domain. Fifth, and most importantly, breaking this important promise, using the alibi of the COVID-19 pandemic causes a serious dent in the trust built up between the Centre and States. Cooperative federalism is in the nature of a ?repeated game? between the two entities, and every action must think of the future consequences, not just the immediate ones. Will it not weaken the foundation of trust?

Kautilya too would have advised the sovereign against reneging on the promised bailout, as fulfilling the obligation helps build trust with sub-sovereigns. The issue of GST compensation to the States is just the latest in the bumpy three-year journey of the new tax design. It is clear that the design needs a radical overhaul. Just tinkering with the compensation mechanism, or frequently changing rate slabs, or pushing more goods in the ?sin tax? cess category, to earn revenue that is not shareable with the States, is not the way forward. What we instead need is a Grand Bargain 2.0 between the sovereign and the sub-sovereign entities.

What would this be based upon? We have to go back to first principles. GST is a destination-based consumption tax, which must include all goods and services with very few exceptions, such as food and medicine. That widening of the tax base itself will allow us to go back to the original recommendation of a standard rate of 12%, to be fixed for at least a five-year period. A comparison with Australia which also coincidentally shares its GST anniversary with India, is apt. For the past two decades their GST rate has been constant at 10%. Of course India?s single rate of 12% has to cover petrol, diesel, electricity, transport and real estate as well. Some extra elbow room for the States? revenue autonomy is obtained by allowing the States non VATable surcharges on a small list of ?sin? goods such as liquor, tobacco, polluting goods such as sport utility vehicles, and industrial fuels such as diesel, aviation turbine fuel and coal. A low moderate single rate of 12% encourages better compliance, reduces the need to do arbitrary classification and discretion, reduces litigation and will lead to buoyancy in collection.

Incidentally this redesign will scrupulously avoid the bogey of a ?revenue neutral rate? (RNR) which needlessly occupied the attention of lawmakers and officials. GST is a long-term structural reform, while RNR is a short term and basically an elusive concept. In the long term there are many changes in consumption patterns, production configurations and locations, which cannot be anticipated and hence a static concept of RNR cannot be reference. The commitment to a low and stable rate,  la Australia and many other federal democracies, is a must. Of course the compensation-cum-reimbursement incentive can remain, but more in the nature of what was done for VAT harmonisation. his new grand bargain must recognise the increasing importance of the third tier of government. Even after 28 years of the 73rd and 74th Amendments, the local governments do not have the promised transfer of funds, functions and functionaries. These local bodies face increased responsibility of providing government services especially in view of increased urbanisation and decentralisation. Of the 12% GST, 10% should be equally shared between the States and the Centre, and 2% must be earmarked exclusively for the urban and rural local bodies, which ensures some basic revenue autonomy to them. The actual distribution across panchayats, districts and cities would be given by respective State Finance Commissions. GST consumption tax paid by every citizen establishes a tighter link between the governed and the government. The quality of governance improves as also, the tax base is better aligned with responsibilities of various tiers of government.",,,
