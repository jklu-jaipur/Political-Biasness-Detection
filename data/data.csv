1,Article 370,"Jammu and Kashmir has been a theatre of muscular Hindutva nationalism, in the early decades in script and since 2014 in performance. Adopting a highly militarist approach to separatism, and shunning political process entirely since 2014, the BJP has now delivered on a promise it has long made, by abrogating the special status that Jammu and Kashmir had enjoyed in the Constitution through a combination of executive and parliamentary measures. Additionally, the State is being downgraded and divided into two Union Territories. The mechanism that the government used to railroad its rigid ideological position on Jammu and Kashmir through the Rajya Sabha was both hasty and stealthy. This move will strain India?s social fabric not only in its impact on Jammu and Kashmir but also in the portents it holds for federalism, parliamentary democracy and diversity. The BJP-led government has undermined parliamentary authority in multiple ways since 2014, but the passing of legislation as far-reaching as dismembering a State without prior consultations has set a new low. The founding fathers of the Republic favoured a strong Centre, but they were also prudent in seeking the route of persuasion and accommodation towards linguistic and religious minorities in the interest of national integration. The centralising tendencies increased in the following decades, but Hindu nationalists always argued for stronger unitary provisions and viewed all particular aspirations with suspicion. For them, Jammu and Kashmir?s special constitutional status was an impediment, not an instrument, for the region?s integration with the rest of the country.
 
The entire exercise of getting Article 370 of the Constitution effectively abrogated has been marked by executive excess. The first step was to declare by a presidential decree that the ?Governor? ? without regard to the fact that he has no Council of Ministers now to aid and advise him ? can speak for the State government and give his concurrence to any modification in the way the Constitution of India applies to Jammu and Kashmir. Second, on the basis of this ?concurrence?, the latest Presidential Order scraps the previous one of 1954, abrogating the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. Third, the fact that the State is under President?s Rule has been used to usher in a new dispensation under which Jammu and Kashmir becomes a Union Territory with a legislature and Ladakh another such territory without a legislature. In sum, a purported process to change the constitutional status of a sensitive border State has been achieved without any legislative input or representative contribution from its people. The bifurcation of States in the past cannot be cited as a binding precedent as, under Article 3 of the Constitution, the President seeks the views of the legislature of the States concerned, even if concurrence is not mandatory. In the present scenario, J&K has been represented by an unelected Governor appointed by the Centre, while Parliament has ventured to ratify the conversion of a State into two Union Territories without any recommendation from the State.

If there is a legal challenge to these measures, it would centre around whether such far-reaching steps could be achieved in the absence of a representative government by assuming that its gubernatorial administrator is constitutionally capable of using his consent as that of the entire State. Further, there is a self-enabling aspect to the Presidential Order. It performs a hop-step-and-jump feat. It hops over the requirement of the State government?s consent by declaring that the Governor is the State government. It steps over the need for aid and advice by the ministerial council by saying the Governor?s opinion is enough. And it jumps over the fact that there is no constituent assembly now by merely reading the term as ?legislative assembly?, and letting Parliament perform the role of the State legislature. Thus the President?s power under Article 370 has been used both to create an enabling provision and to exercise it immediately to modify the Order, thereby dispensing with the role envisaged for the State Assembly. While it is true that in 1961 the Supreme Court upheld the President?s power to ?modify? the constitutional provisions in applying them to J&K, it is a moot question whether this can be invoked to make such a radical change: a functioning State has now been downgraded and bifurcated into two Union Territories. It is inconceivable that any State legislature would ever have recommended its own demotion in status.


True, the special status of J&K was meant to end, but only with the concurrence of its people. The Centre?s abrupt move disenfranchised them on a matter that directly affected their life and sentiments. Moreover, that this was done after a massive military build-up and the house arrest of senior political leaders, and the communications shutdown reveals a cynical disregard of democratic norms. It appears that the current government values J&K for its demonstrative impact before the rest of the country, as a place where a strong nation and its strong leader show uncompromising political will. But that may have other unintended consequences. Geographically and metaphorically, Jammu and Kashmir is the crown of secular India ? a Muslim majority region in a Hindu majority country. Its people and leaders had chosen secular India over Islamic Pakistan, a fact that Islamists never reconciled with. The BJP?s adventurous route also has as backdrop an impending U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that will trigger an unforeseeable churn in Islamist politics in the region. Islamists have always viewed Kashmir as a component of their global grievances. Whatever its intent in enabling the full integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India, Monday?s decision to alter the State?s status could have unintended and dangerous consequences.",Scrapping J&K's special status is the wrong way to an end,The Hindu,UPA
2,Article 370,"In a momentous decision, government moved Parliament yesterday to abate Article 370 of the Constitution and supersede Article 35A, thereby effectively ceasing the special status for Jammu & Kashmir. Simultaneously, Union home minister Amit Shah introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill to bifurcate the state and create two separate Union territories ? Jammu & Kashmir with a legislature, and Ladakh without a legislature. This means that the Constitution of India shall now apply in full force across J&K and Ladakh, and the J&K legislature will henceforth not have any discretionary powers to decide who permanent residents of the territory are or provide them with special rights with respect to employment and acquisition of property.
Abrogating Article 370 has been a long-held wish of BJP which sees the provision as a historical wrong. However, the complicated history of Kashmir and the sensitivity surrounding the matter had hitherto prevented such a move. But with the current BJP government projecting muscular nationalism and enjoying significant numerical strength in Parliament, cessation of Article 370 became more doable. Given that abrogating Article 370 was part of the BJP manifesto, on the basis of which it swept Lok Sabha polls, the government has the mandate to do this. That non-NDA parties like BSP, AAP, YSRCP, BJD and AIADMK too have come out in support of the government?s move shows which way the winds are blowing.
Arguably, Article 370 had contributed to the problems in Kashmir. The state?s special powers of autonomy meant in practice arrogation of power by a tiny Valley elite, which led to a feeling of not being represented among the people of Jammu and Ladakh, as well as disaffection feeding into separatist sentiment in the Valley itself. And given that Kashmir came to be a troubled state with separatist sentiments being stoked by Pakistan with the help of cross-border terrorism, this may have been the worst of both worlds. Besides, Article 370 was meant to be a temporary provision. In that sense its cessation now is congruent with historical constitutional perspective.
That said, there are some issues with the way in which Article 370 is being nullified and the state bifurcated. Even according to the constitutional provision to abate Article 370, consultation with the J&K state assembly is deemed necessary before a constitutional order to this effect is passed. The government, however, has chosen to use the fact that there is no J&K government at the moment and substituted the latter with the J&K governor. While this approach may or may not be legally valid, it certainly bypasses wider discussion on the matter that would have been democratically sound.
Second, the logic behind converting the state into two Union territories is also not plain. True, there has been a demand for Union territory status in Ladakh for some time. But with the cessation of Article 370, the special powers accruing to the J&K assembly in Srinagar would also extinguish. Thus, it is debatable if bifurcation of the state and creation of the Union territory of Ladakh was necessary after that.
In fact, this would be the first time in the history of India that a state was being converted into Union territories ? the trend has been the other way around. Hence, given the magnitude of the decision, more all-round discussion would have been prudent. But perhaps government?s decision to push ahead with its Article 370 move was linked to external factors. With the US looking to wind down its military engagement in Afghanistan and turning to Pakistan to facilitate a peace deal with Afghan Taliban, Islamabad has been upping the ante on Kashmir.
New Delhi perhaps felt that Islamabad was gaining too much leverage in the emerging regional scenario and had to do something to counter this. Whatever the compulsions, even if Article 370 is abrogated New Delhi will have to ? sooner rather than later ? grant full statehood rights to Jammu & Kashmir and perhaps Ladakh too, for the sake of democratic governance as well as the federal principles in which India is grounded.","Changing the game in Kashmir: In nullifying Article 370 and bifurcating state, government has redrawn strategic calculus",The times of India,Neutral
3,Article 370,"India?s shock decision this week to revoke the autonomy of its restive state of Jammu and Kashmir is a crucial test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Without a change of course, he?s likely to fail.

Kashmir is arguably the worst legacy of the fratricidal partition of British India in 1947. One of more than 500 princely states in the subcontinent at the time, its Hindu ruler cast his lot with India after tribal fighters from Pakistan attempted his overthrow. The two nations have since fought three wars over the overwhelmingly Muslim territory. India controls the bulk of the state; Pakistan administers about a third and China claims a portion of its Himalayan plateau.


How India treats its portion of Kashmir matters for two reasons. One is that the state is the primary flashpoint for the world?s most dangerous nuclear rivalry; terrorist attacks there have repeatedly brought India and Pakistan to the brink of hostilities. It?s also the lone Muslim-majority state within Hindu-majority India, and thus an essential test of the country?s diversity and tolerance.

Given these sensitivities, Modi?s government might?ve approached the matter with discretion. Quite the opposite. With no warning, it revoked Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which granted Kashmir a degree of autonomy, while breaking up the state into two ?union territories? largely controlled from New Delhi. Authorities placed hundreds of local leaders under house arrest, dispatched thousands of troops to the already heavily militarized state, evacuated tourists, imposed a curfew, and cut off communications links. The parliamentary maneuvers the government used to ram through its decision were so dubious they?ve already landed before the Supreme Court.


All this hardly needed doing: Most of the special privileges afforded to the state on paper had long been whittled away in practice. Nor is anyone challenging the unique rights enjoyed by some other states in India. The clear implication is that Modi?s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was intent on eliminating rather than celebrating a Muslim-majority state.


Changing Kashmir?s status won?t do anything to ease tensions with Pakistan. To the contrary, it will further empower the Pakistani military, long the main roadblock to peace on the subcontinent. India desperately needs a real strategy to engage with Pakistan, commercially as well as diplomatically. Instead Modi?s government seems convinced it can continue to ignore, isolate and deter its rival. One result is that trade between the two countries has now broken down entirely.

Perhaps most galling, though, is that Modi neglected to bring on board those Indians with the greatest stake in his decision: Kashmiris. BJP officials insist that closer integration will improve the lives of Kashmiris by opening the floodgates to jobs and investment, but this is questionable. (Private investment in India hit a 14-year low earlier this year, while unemployment stands at a 45-year high.) In any case, a sudden influx of outside businesses would fuel paranoia and resentment among locals, as it has wherever else such policies have been tried.

The issue India ultimately needs to address in Kashmir isn?t a lack of jobs, or even Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. It?s the lack of agency felt by too many Kashmiris, exacerbated by a suffocating security presence they view as an occupation. Forcibly imposing the central government?s will over the state will only intensify those grievances.

Democracies as large and heterogeneous as India cannot escape internal tensions. But the way to relieve such pressure is to decentralize power and give citizens a greater stake in their governance, as well as more control over local resources.

Modi?s government is heading in the opposite direction in Kashmir. Until India finds some way to make Kashmiris feel like full citizens, in control of their lives and their destinies, their land will remain what it has been for far too long: a troubled place, and a threat to peace and prosperity.",India Is Making a Mistake in Kashmir,Bloomberg,UPA
4,Article 370,"The reading down of Article 370, which granted limited autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmir hereafter), by the Indian parliament on August 5, 2019, has evoked strong reactions from the supporters and the opponents of this move.  

Those in favour of repealing Article 370 have often argued that its revocation is consistent with the principles of Indian federalism (albeit in more crude terms).

They contend that while state governments may exist and deal specifically with local issues, ultimately, the federal government should reign supreme.

Following this line of reasoning, Kashmir?s special status under the constitution is an affront to the founding principles of India. To constrain the Union government?s powers to make legislation affecting Kashmiris is to elevate Kashmir?s status above all other Indian states. And that is something India?s ruling party and its supporters simply cannot abide.  

These notions certainly seem to be forthcoming in Indian Home Minister Amit Shah?s position on the special status of Kashmir. In a speech made to Parliament, he asserted ?This treaty (Instrument of Accession) was not only made with Jammu-Kashmir, it was made with the 630 princely states of the nation. The treaty was made with 630 princely states, and 370 was not there.?

The claim that Kashmir?s instrument of accession (IOA) was functionally no different to those signed by other princely states is incredibly disingenuous.

By signing the IOA, the princely states ceded power to the dominion of India regarding defence, external affairs and communications. If the process of integration had stopped there, India would have remained a loose federation of autonomous states.

The India we know today was formed through a series of merger agreements signed by the heads of princely states, which incorporated their polities into the Union of India. These merger agreements were often signed under duress with limited reference to the interests of the people they were affecting. Regardless, however, they can be perceived to have been accepted and entrenched by the acquiescence of subsequent generations residing in the state. 

A faulty argument

Kashmir is different from other princely states because it never signed a merger agreement fully accepting the constitution of India. Instead, it explicitly negotiated autonomy which was entrenched in the Indian constitution through Article 370.

The provision allowed Kashmir to have a parallel constitution, ensuring that the provisions of Indian constitution were effective in Kashmir only with the concurrence of the Kashmir assembly ?  representative body of the state.

In light of this, to claim Kashmir?s treaty was the same as that signed by 630 other states is to reduce the complex process of integration to one document. Integration was a multi-stage process that required negotiation with various princely states and unions. It cannot be condensed into a single procedure, as the BJP would have the world believe. 

One justification for the reading down of Article 370 offered by the ruling BJP and its supporters is that it would accelerate the economic development of the state. Dubious as this argument is, even if one were to take it seriously, it would call for convincing the people of Kashmir, or their elected representatives, to vote for a complete integration with India.

There is a precedent for it. The state of Sikkim signed a treaty with India in 1950, which limited the role of India to defence, external affairs and communication, similar to the IOA signed with princely states. It was only in 1975 that Sikkim was fully integrated with India after its assembly passed a resolution to this effect and was ratified by a statewide referendum. That is the democratic way!

Ultimately, however, Modi?s government seems unconcerned with historical realities in its path to reading down Kashmir?s constitutional protections. In light of this, pointing to the inaccuracies in the way Kashmir?s IOA and Article 370 are construed are unlikely to alter the position of BJP supporters and their ilk. 

What hope then is left for those in favour of upholding Kashmir?s constitutional status?

One option would be to seek a remedy under international law. This would involve making appeals to an international community that is often reticent to intervene in state matters, particularly when questions of ?territorial integrity? and sovereignty are raised.

Additionally, even if the international law could provide a resolution, its primary body, the International Court of Justice relies on the consent of the involved parties to hear matters. That nationalistic vigour with which the BJP has promoted its position on Kashmir makes it seem incredibly unlikely that it would now surrender itself to international law.  

The Supreme Court

Perhaps a more realistic prospect is a favourable ruling from the Supreme Court of India. The question of whether Article 370 is indefinitely entrenched in the Indian constitution has been a vexing one for Indian courts. The article provides that it may only be repealed in conjunction with the assent of Kashmir?s constituent assembly. That body was dissolved in 1957 and made no recommendations regarding an amendment to Article 370.


This poses a challenging issue for Indian courts as to whether the requirement for assent from the constituent assembly is a dead letter. Lower courts in India have posited that the requirement continues to operate, with Kashmir?s state government now taking the place of the constituent assembly. Some, perhaps more ambitiously, have posited that following the dissolution of the constituent assembly, Article 370 has an eternal effect.

In any case, treating the assent of the governor of the state, a representative of the centre, as tantamount to the assent of Kashmiris or their representatives, which is what the current process of abrogation of article 370 has done, would make a mockery of the notion of federalism. 

If the Supreme Court rejects these views and upholds the unilateral reading down of Article 370, an intriguing paradox comes into play for the BJP. Kashmir?s IOA, which had been entrenched in Article 370(b)(i), would be successfully dislodged from the Indian constitution.

This would relegate the IOA?s legitimacy in the domestic sphere and significantly alter the constitutional protections on Kashmiri autonomy.

Problematically though, the IOA is the very nexus of India?s claims over Kashmir, which it often reverts to in disputes with Pakistan. It is the legal validation of Kashmir?s status as de jure Indian territory.

Declaring the instrument meaningless would betray the inconsistencies of India?s position over Kashmir. It would involve undermining the very document which India relies on as a source of its authority before the international community. 

The aforementioned situation creates a paradox, which calls for immediate explanation. It seems that Modi is faced with a perplexing choice. He may either relentlessly dismiss the rights of Kashmiris or maintain India?s legitimacy in the global sphere. ",Article 370 and The Paradox of Kashmir?s Accession,The Wire,UPA
5,Article 370,"The NDA government?s decision to abrogate the special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 fulfills a nearly 70-year-old project of Hindutva parties, their promise that they would one day make the ?integration? of J&K with the Union of India a reality. The Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order 2019 supersedes the 1954 order, which included Article 35 A, and defined the state?s special status. Article 35 A has ceased to exist. Although Article 370 remains, it?s effectively dead. The government has simultaneously proposed the bifurcation of the state through the Jammu & Kashmir State Reorganisation Bill 2019, under which it will become two Union Territories, one comprising Ladakh without a legislature, another comprising Jammu & Kashmir, with a legislature.

But the special status guaranteed to Jammu and Kashmir was not a partisan or personal decision of the founding fathers of the Indian republic. It was based in the imperative of nation-building. It was a recognition of the role a Muslim majority state ? its unique demography protected by the Constitution ? would play in belying the claims on which Partition had taken place, and in strengthening the secular ?idea of India?. The developments of August 5, 2019, are in no small measure about rewriting history, changing that very demography, and bringing in a new idea of India, with the stamp of Narendra Modi firmly on it. The changes are no less than historic, they draw an audacious red line over and across the Nehruvian idea of India.

But what is this new idea of India, and how will it be given shape? What will also go down in history is the manner in which the momentous change in J&K?s status has been brought about. There is no parallel in the history of independent India for the secrecy and stealth deployed by the government to bring in something that is politically and communally contentious. To do this at a time when Parliament is in session, to present it as a virtual fait accompli to the House, may be the BJP?s way of doing business, as it believes it has the mandate. But it goes against every democratic convention and norm.

Curiously, government officials put out the red herring of a purported terror plot emanating from Pakistan to justify the induction of additional troops in the Valley and cancellation of the Amarnath Yatra. As it has turned out, these were law and order measures in anticipation of a backlash to the government?s real plans. For the first time since the 1953 arrest of Sheikh Abdullah, the government placed two former chief ministers, both leaders of mainstream political parties, under arrest.

The promise of resolving the Kashmir issue through partnership and dialogue with Kashmiris, articulated by a BJP prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and carried forward by a Congress prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was implicit in the PDP-BJP alliance of 2015-2018. It failed, yet as recently as last year, Prime Minister Modi invoked Vajpayee?s ?insaaniyat, jahmuriyat, Kashmiriyat? credo for resolution in Kashmir. It now seems that he and his trusted lieutenant believe that the people of Kashmir need not be consulted at all about their political fate, and that the use of force can overcome their opposition.

Now that the die has been cast, how the government proposes to carry this forward from here, how it will deal with the legal and political fallout and the reactions in the Valley, will decide many things for India. If the unkept promise of autonomy in Article 370 was the genesis of the Kashmir problem, the government has significantly departed from that, not just by its definitive move to scrap the constitutional guarantee of that autonomy but by demoting the state into truncated union territories that will now be governed directly by the Union home ministry through an all powerful Lt. Governor, working with an emasculated legislature.

Regional parties, such as AIADMK and TRS, that have supported the government?s move, might do well to ask themselves what they would do if the Centre decided that Tamil Nadu, with a traditionally strong regional ethos, be carved up into union territories. But the challenge for the Opposition is also more than a distant thought experiment. It is real and it is already here: A BJP that is bringing its ?core issues? ? for long relegated to the backburner ? to centrestage. A BJP with a mandate that will have its way, few questions asked.

It cannot be the government?s intention to keep voices in the Valley suppressed forever. For starters, it must release Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Sajjad Lone, leaders with a following in the Valley and in Jammu too. It must remove restrictions on movement in the Valley, allow telecommunications to be restarted. It must demonstrate that its political confidence to do what it has done in Kashmir does not flow out of the barrel of a gun or a numerical majority alone. There will be other challenges, such as the changing dynamics in the region, especially the deal with Pakistan?s help, in Afghanistan between the US and Taliban. This is hard work in progress even though the deed has been done.","Rupture in history, stitching a future",The Indian Express,NDA
6,Article 370,"The narrative around Article 370 has largely been premised on the argument that it was meant to be a ?temporary provision?. This argument draws its basis from the Marginal Note to Article 370, which contain the words ?temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir?. However, we must remember the place of Marginal Notes in interpreting a statute.  

English courts were cautious in using Marginal Notes. On different occasions, they have referred to them as a ?most unsure guide to construction? and a ?poor guide to the scope of a section?, further stating that ?rarely it might throw some light to the intentions of the Parliament? etc.

The Indian Supreme Court too, [for a long time], followed the same approach and refrained from employing Marginal Notes to interpret a statute. The Supreme Court, while interpreting an Article of the Constitution, referred to the Marginal Note, only to get a prima facie clue to the purpose of the Article, and in case of a conflict between the Marginal Note and the main provision, the Marginal Note gives way to the main provision. The approach of the Government to except, modify or amend Article 370 seems to be influenced by the Marginal Note to the Article.  

Article 370(3) gives the power to the President of India to declare that the Article has ceased to be operative and is a dead letter of the Constitution. Noticeably, Article 370(3) has a strong ?proviso?. One of the functions of a ?proviso? in an enactment, as stated by the Supreme Court, is to ?entirely change the very concept of the intendment of the enactment by insisting on certain mandatory conditions to be fulfilled in order to make the enactment workable?.

The proviso to Article 370(3), which states that the President ?shall? obtain recommendation of the Constituent Assembly before making such declaration, clearly imposes the mandatory condition on the President of obtaining the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir before the power to cause Article 370 to be inoperative is exercised. . The Constituent Assembly of J&K, which was constituted by a proclamation of the Maharaja of Jammu & Kashmir in 1951, was dissolved in 1957 and  presently there is no Constituent Assembly.  

After the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, Article 370 ceased to be a ?temporary provision? not amenable to modification and exception through a Presidential Order. This contention is best understood, if one reads the article without reading the Marginal note, for the body of the provision does not at all use the word ?temporary?.

The Constitution Order, 2019 (C.O.272)
The BJP obviously has been reading the Marginal Note of Article 370 with greater emphasis and the main provision with greater disdain and lesser care. The recent developments are an actualization of the longstanding agenda of the BJP, reflected consistently in its election manifestos ? including the 2019 one ? which stated ??We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Article 370. We are committed to annulling Article 35A of the Constitution of India as the provision is discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir??.

In order to annul Article 35A, a suitable order had to be passed under Article 370(1) and to abrogate Article 370, the President needed to make a declaration under Article 370(3), which he could not achieve without the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly, which no longer exists. The Supreme Court has, on several occasions, returned a finding that Article 370 has become a permanent provision for this very same reason, i.e. it cannot be abrogated anymore as the Constituent Assembly, whose recommendation is a requirement for abrogation, has ceased to exist.

The government of the day has achieved its objective through means that would elicit disapproval from constitutional purists. By the Constitutional Order 272, the Government has superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954 ? under which Article 35A was inserted ? and additionally, has given a fatal blow to Article 370, by replacing the expression ""Constituent Assembly? with ?legislative assembly? in order to bring about its abrogation,.  

Assault on Federalism
The position of Jammu and Kashmir is unique ? both within the Union of India and also in the Indian Constitution. Jammu and Kashmir was a princely state that acceded to the Union under special circumstances.

Gopalaswami Iyengar, while moving the draft provision (Article 306A, which was renumbered as Article 370) before the constituent assembly, spelt out those special circumstances. While elucidating the case for special treatment under the constitution, he emphasized that the Government of India had committed that the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir ? expressed through its constituent assembly ? would determine the sphere of jurisdiction of the Union over the state.

In the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly, Sheikh Abdullah cautioned ?that any suggestion of altering arbitrarily the basis of our relationship with India would constitute a breach of the spirit and the letter of the Constitution??.

Article 370, therefore, stands like a constitutional guarantee setting out the terms under which the princely state came to join the Union. Jammu and Kashmir, as a federating unit of the Union of India, joined the Union under the promise recognised by the constituent assembly of India and crystalized by the Constitution of India under Article 370. Altering those promises and modifying the special relationship in the manner that has been done under the constitutional orders is an assault on this particular federal relationship. The Supreme Court of India has recognized federalism as the basic structure of the constitution and the abrogation of Article 370 is destructive of federalism and therefore an assault on the basic structure of the Indian constitution.

Another agenda of the BJP is to ensure the construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhaya and its members often refer to the creation of Ram Rajya in India. The BJP may like to be reminded that one of the inviolable principles of Ram Rajya is ?Raghu kul reet sada chali aaee, prana jayee par vachan na jaaee? (It is the tradition of Raghu?s dynasty, to which Lord Ram belonged, that a promise given is to be honoured, even at the cost of life).  

The abrogation of Article 370 is letting go of the promise that the framers of the constitution had made to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

7,Article 370,"The contentious Article 370 is part of the history now. In a predictable move after days of troop buildup in the Kashmir valley, the Modi Government on Monday scrapped Article 370 to do away with Jammu & Kashmir?s special status and also proposed the bifurcation of the State into two union territories, Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh.

By doing so, the BJP-led dispensation hopes to fulfill its poll promise and deal with a protracted militancy movement that has been ravaging the State for past three decades.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced the decision in the Rajya Sabha, which approved the resolution and the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill. Both will now come up in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

The Government?s effort to tackle head-on the vexatious 72-year-old problem wracking the soul of the nation sent a wave of jubilation among BJP supporters and others, but provoked outrage from the National Conference and the PDP, the principal political parties in Jammu & Kashmir.

According to the resolution moved by the Home Minister, Article 370 ceases to be operative from Monday itself. ?The President on the recommendation of Parliament is pleased to declare as from 5th of August 2019, all clauses of the said Article 370 shall cease to be operative...,? the resolution stated.

Shah also moved a Bill proposing bifurcation of J&K into two union territories ? Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. The union territory in Ladakh will have no legislature like Chandigarh. The other union territory of Jammu & Kashmir will have a legislature like Delhi and Puducherry, where key subjects like law and order are with the Centre.

Shah said full statehood will be restored to Jammu & Kashmir at ?appropriate time? and after ?normalcy? returns. The Government will not allow the situation to turn into another battle torn Kosovo, he said.

The Government hopes that abrogation of Article 370 that accorded special status to Jammu & Kashmir and the consequential end of Article 35A that defines the permanent residents of the State will help in the integration of the erstwhile J&K State into the Union of India like any other state or union territories and cease special rights enjoyed by its citizens on land, business and employment.

As the Government moved a Bill to convert J&K into a union territory with an Assembly and a Lieutenant Governor and thereby the Centre wielding major power over it, the State has ?lost? its privileged status like Assembly enjoying six-year tenure, outsiders not allowed to buy land and Kashmiri women marrying outside forfeiting their rights over land in Kashmir. 

Twenty four seats which fall in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) shall remain vacant in new Assembly of J&K union territory.

Abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35-A would permit citizens outside Kashmir to move in, settle and start business in the new union territory of J&K, barring special restrictions imposed by its Government. The Union Government would now play a central role in controlling State police and land issues.

Lt Governor who will ?consult the Election Commission? will have final powers over deciding the disqualification of Assembly members in J&K. Its Assembly will not legislate on ?public order? and ?police?. Law of Parliament ?shall prevail? if a law made in State list in the seventh schedule to the Constitution ?is repugnant to any provision of law made by Parliament?.

Similarly, ?a Bill or amendment shall not be introduced in Legislative Assembly except on recommendation of the Lt Governor? on imposition, abolition, remission, alternation of any tax or relation to consolidated fund of India, seats for SC/STs would be reserved in J&K Assembly.

According to the Government, the abolition of Article 370 will ?completely integrate? the State with the Indian Union like other princely States in 1950 and its residents will enjoy equal rights like other citizens.

The large population of young Kashmiris, studying and working in other States of India will get the ?power and confidence? to be equal citizens of India, without they being categorised as a special citizen.

According to Government officials, the ease with which private and public investment will flow into both these new UTs will lead to much faster development of the economy, the development of high-quality educational institutions and the flow of a large corpus of funds to develop tourism in these underdeveloped regions, they said.

The Presidential order signed by the President of India has not scrapped Article 370. But invoking this very Article, special status of J&K has been withdrawn. Thus Article 370 is very much on the statute book, say constitutional and legal experts.

Some insignificant amendments have been made by this order such as substitution of term Constituent Assembly by the State by the Legislative Assembly of State and Sadar-e-Riyasat by the Governor of State.

8,Article 370,"It?s been two months since the government decided to push through constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in Parliament. Article 370 was effectively abrogated; the state was bifurcated; and J&K and Ladakh, it was decided, would now become Union Territories (UTs). The constitutional changes ? and there is no doubt that the government had adequate mandate and legislative support for it ? were accompanied by a clampdown in the Valley. Communication links were snapped. Security mobilisation was ramped up. Political leaders, including those who had sworn by the Indian Constitution, were detained.


The government?s case was simple. It argued that restrictions were necessary to prevent violence, for ease of communication and mobility would give terrorists an advantage. This, to be fair, has proved effective, for compared to earlier protests, killings have been at a minimal. But this has come at a cost. Civil liberties and fundamental rights of citizens ? and Kashmiris are entitled to the same rights as all other Indians ? were compromised. Normal life was affected. And political mobilisation ? once again a key democratic right ? was curtailed.

It is time for a review. The government must now lift restrictions, without compromising security. It must release Kashmir?s mainstream leaders, of the National Conference, the Peoples Democratic Party, as well as other smaller forces which have participated in elections under the Indian constitutional framework. These leaders have spoken up for India in difficult of times. Terrorists have killed thousands of mainstream activists because of their pro-India stance. The continued detention of these leaders only strengthens the Valley?s radicals. Their release will benefit Delhi in two ways. For one, its ambition of bringing development to J&K cannot be fulfilled without local partners; elections in the UT would not have legitimacy without the participation of locally established forces; and democratic activity needs to find an outlet. And second, releasing leaders will allay apprehensions in the international community. The fact that the leading contender for the Democratic nomination in the US presidential race, Elizabeth Warren, has now expressed concern must caution Delhi that international attention is not fading. but growing. For India to fulfil domestic objectives, and win international support, Kashmir needs to open up.",Free Kashmir?s democrats ,The Hindustan Times,Neutral
9,Article 370,"A balm is usually administered after a bitter pill. The prime minister?s recent address to the nation, three days after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government decided to do away with Jammu and Kashmir?s special status and statehood, is perhaps a case in point. In his speech ? a barely disguised attempt to mollify an aggrieved constituency ? Narendra Modi made a number of promises. The prime minister assured his audience, among other things, a gradual relaxation of prohibitory orders, an election that would, Mr Modi is certain, lead to a ?government by the people and of the people?, as well as the speedy implementation of development. All of these pledges sound reassuring. But there is a case to argue that the people in Kashmir as well as those concerned with the goings-on in that restive state would have been far more satisfied if Mr Modi ? a stickler for deadlines ? had spelt out a concrete time frame to implement his pledges. The absence of a timetable for the restoration of statehood is certain to inflict yet another blow to the morale of a people who have expressed their resentment, time and again, against what they claim are unilateral interventions from the Centre.

There is no doubt about the fact that the BJP?s move to do away with most of the provisions of Article 370 enjoys considerable public support. The rhetoric of triumphant nationalism advocated by the prime minister and his party has even forced segments in the Opposition to toe the BJP?s line on Kashmir. But Kashmir remains sceptical of the BJP?s promises and design. Mr Modi may be aware of this simmering discontent. That could explain why the prime minister in his speech chose not to refer to some telling anomalies. If, as Mr Modi claims, Article 370 had bred only ?separatism?, why is it that its abrogation has been met with such hostility in Kashmir itself? The anger in Kashmir ? communication links with the state remain tenuous for days now ? cannot be a testimony to the oneness that the BJP claims to have achieved. The trouble with Mr Modi?s party lies in its conflation of unity with unilateralism. This aggression is against the formative idea of India itself, a vision that championed the cause of accommodation and federalism. The key to the Kashmir problem lies in resurrecting the flickering spirit of democratic assimilation.",Kashmir: Swallowing a bitter pill,The Telegraph,NDA

12,Farm Bill,"The passage of two key farm reform bills by Parliament with the potential to boost farm incomes and productivity should have been a historic occasion. When Parliament is called upon to perform its job of discussing, scrutinising and enacting pathbreaking legislations, the government of the day must go out of the way to ensure orderly functioning and build a consensus, if possible. Unfortunately, the Farmers? Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, did not get the solidarity they deserved.

While envisaging a big leap in agricultural trade, the legislations chip away at regulatory privileges enjoyed by state governments. This has stoked farmer unrest in some states and many non-BJP ruled states, and opposition MPs, commanding respectable numbers in Rajya Sabha, came prepared for a confrontation. Two key demands ? examination of bills by a select committee and deferment of headcount ? didn?t find favour with the government and the House chair. Checks and balances enshrined in parliamentary processes must be given their due respect. In a truncated session, MPs have had little say in the two important legislations, promulgated as ordinances earlier. A select committee could have made suggestions and amendments palatable to the opposition and useful for the government. But that was not to be.

Reliance on a voice vote hasn?t helped the government either. This allowed the opposition to question the numbers in support of the bill. A contested passage doesn?t portend well for the Centre. It could increase resistance on the ground and give momentum to protests. That could in turn hold up more reforms that are keenly needed. Citing the divisiveness, opposing states could throttle the reforms, as has happened to many well-intentioned schemes.

Opposition?s attempt to create a spectacle of protest by heckling the deputy chairman at very close quarters, breaking a mic, and tearing official papers was crass and self-defeating. A race to the bottom with no winners is evident in Rajya Sabha TV arbitrarily muting the live feed before the House adjourned, purportedly to prevent airing of the commotion to a national audience, and the MPs recording their own shenanigans on smartphones. Far from impressing ordinary citizens, the political divisiveness is deeply distressing for them. Parliament must serve to reassure the public, uphold due process and serve as an oasis of calm, reasoned debate amid a worsening economic crisis.",Lost in chaos: An opportunity to present a farm reforms package through political consensus,The times of India,Neutral
13,Farm Bill,"Big changes are afoot in Indian agriculture, driven by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at considerable political risk. Freeing up farming markets may be as significant as dismantling industrial licenses in 1991. However, if the state?s protection withers away only to reveal a few large capitalists as the new overlords, there will be chaos and misery rather than progress and prosperity.

To gauge the scale of what?s being done, picture the depth of the stasis: 119 million cultivators and 144 million farmhands ? taken together, 10 times Australia?s population ? yoked to a marketplace designed to be anti-competitive, and denied the lift in productivity that propelled urbanization from Japan and South Korea to Taiwan and China.

?It?s like a massive old table in the center of the room, crawling with parasites.? That?s how Hemant Gaur, an entrepreneur who?s bringing technology to potato farming in India, describes to me the ?mandi,? or the designated market yard in which produce changes hands. ?We dared not discard it, because how would we ever replace it??

Finally, Modi has thrown out the old furniture by ramming legislation through parliament, passed by a dubious voice vote. Now growers don?t have to bring their harvests to the mandi. They can sell it at farm gates, factories, warehouses, silos, and cold storages. The market yard remains, but can?t charge any fee on transactions outside its physical space. Trades can take place online. Farmers can enter five-year, fixed-price contracts with corporate buyers. The government will tame only excessive price increases rather than impose caps on incremental jitters; free markets will be the rule.

The repercussions will reverberate across the world?s second-most populous country. India?s sheer size as a producer and consumer means ripples may also be felt as a long-term deflationary wave in global food prices.

Gaur?s SV Agri Pvt. operates at the intersection of technology and farming. It produces and markets seeds and inputs to farmers, buys back and stores their potatoes in modern warehouses before supplying firms that make crisps and snacks. In one stroke, the 2.5% mandi tax Gaur pays in Uttar Pradesh, India?s largest state, is gone. With the more efficient procurement that makes possible, he reckons on savings of up to 10%. The efficiency gains will be shared by farmers, processors and consumers. They?ll lead to more investments in cold chains, and less wastage, a huge problem.

But without the fees and commissions, the market yards may atrophy, and the local elite that?s thrived off the system but also buffered it could lose its sway, leaving farmers at the mercy of traders? cartels controlled by corporate monopolies. This could be particularly true in the grain-producing belt of Punjab and Haryana, where the percentage cut in mandi taxes and other levies is in double digits. No wonder that political opposition will be fiercest in these northern states.

Modi has gambled big before, with some disastrous results. It?s asking a lot of people in rural India to trust him again. The ban on most currency notes in 2016 was supposed to immobilize tax cheats. It froze the economy. His goods and services tax became a compliance nightmare. Opposition parties claim that the agricultural ?reform,? too, will fail, especially since freedom from the regulated yard in the poor eastern state of Bihar 14 years ago brought the market to the roadside, with no infrastructure and no open auction for price discovery.

Cultivators? biggest fear from deregulation is losing their most important bargaining chip: minimum prices guaranteed by the state. Modi has assured farmers the support will stay by announcing prices for the winter crop, though as farmer activists have noted, the 2.6% increase for wheat is only half the cost escalation.

The need of the hour is for farmers to establish large sales organizations of their own. If state support could give them bargaining power, they wouldn?t be selling cotton to private traders for a quarter less than the guaranteed minimum. How will Modi assure base prices once the mandi system slips into disuse? The professionally run dairy cooperative in Gujarat, the prime minister?s home state, has $5 billion in annual revenue from its Amul brand of milk, butter and cheese. But that movement took shape in a very different political firmament of the 1960s, and it didn?t succeed everywhere or in all commodities.

With all the risks involved, a new farm-to-fork model is still worth it. Boosting agricultural productivity is important for societies to reach the ?Lewis turning point.? Beyond that threshold posited by the economist Arthur Lewis, surplus rural labor ceases to be a drag on urban wages and living standards. Japan got there by nearly tripling per capita output between 1950 and the early 1960s, thanks to the shakeup from General Douglas MacArthur?s postwar land reforms. After independence from the British, India missed its chance to give land to tillers, and allowed absentee landlords to remain backseat drivers of policy.

Almost 9 out of 10 Indian farmers have less than five acres. A majority carry on reluctantly, barely able to scratch out a living. Landless labor is paid to stay in villages with a rural job guarantee from the taxpayer. The pressure of feeding India?s 1.3 billion people has led to suboptimal choices, like a water-guzzling rice crop grown in abundance in Punjab that bleeds aquifers dry. The burning of the paddy residue causes unbearable pollution in New Delhi.

Expected 20-fold growth in online grocery sales over the next five years is the surest shot to end the stifling status quo, provided farmers can unite and hold their own in negotiations with aggregators. With the Covid-19 lockdown hollowing out urban production centers, the rural economy has become more crucial. But free markets should also be fair. Otherwise, India?s farmers will crawl out of a hole only to land in a ditch.","With farm bills, Modi has thrown out old furniture. It was about time",Bloomberg,NDA

15,Farm Bill,"As two of three important farm bills that seek to deregulate the sale of agricultural produce were passed in Rajya Sabha on Sunday, after all three were cleared by Lok Sabha earlier in the week, the story so far: Scenes of uproar and chaos amid an Opposition protest inside the Upper House, street agitations by farmers who are defying restrictions imposed by the pandemic in Punjab and Haryana, a walkout by the sole minister of one of the BJP?s oldest partners, SAD, from the NDA ministry. What should have been a moment to pause and prepare for moving towards a much-promised reform, is now one that ranges the intended beneficiaries against it, alongside the government?s political opponents and an ally. And for this disfigured and disfiguring moment, the government cannot blame the Opposition alone. While the opposition parties may be seizing the visible unrest in sections of the farmers to score a political point, the fact is that the government has wielded a bludgeon when it could have used the subtle powers of Parliament. In fact, the forcible ramming through of the farm bills, the stubborn refusal to concede any elbow room to the Opposition, be it a discussion, a division of votes or a reference to a select committee, underlines a sobering message ? this government may be in its second term, but it does not appear to have as yet understood the importance of Parliament, and of playing by its rules.

In Parliament, and outside it too, it often seems that the government believes that the winner takes all. In a constitutional democracy, however, there are, there must be, checks and balances, spaces for the political opponent and respect for the minority. There must be an attempt to moderate differences and forge common ground ? and the greater onus for this is on the government. Already, amid the pandemic, parliamentary schedules have been truncated. But if the government uses the abbreviated time only to push through legislation ? be it the consequential and crucial farm bills or The Industrial Relations Code Bill, 2020, which could water down the rights and protections of workers in small establishments ? giving short shrift to the need to listen to the suggestions of the people?s representatives or answer the Opposition?s questions, it would be reducing the nation?s highest deliberative forum to a mere clearing house. In an unprecedented pandemic, amid an economic downturn like no other, and with a grave face-off with China on the border, this short-circuiting of debate, and denial of the opportunity for MPs and Opposition to have their say, shrinks the possibilities of democracy to find a way out.

Of course, the farm bills do not merit the fears they appear to have stoked. Only the monopoly of the APMCs is sought to be dismantled, not the MSP regime. In any case, amid the pandemic, government will continue to be top procurer of agricultural produce, the bills will only put in place an enabling architecture for a later much-needed reform. This simple message needs to be communicated. But for it to be heard out, the government will first have to show that it is willing to listen.","Bully & Pulpit

17,Farm Bill,"The unity in the House, for once, was admirable but without a sustained campaign on the ground, visuals are futile

In the end, a moral victory is inconsequential, simply because it doesn?t change the facts on the ground. As noted American satirist HL Mencken said, ?In human history, a moral victory is always a disaster, for it debauches and degrades both the victor and the vanquished.? So though, for once, the Opposition seemed to have got its way in meeting the President over the farm Bills and was united against the Government?s gross subversion of parliamentary procedures in rushing through them in the Rajya Sabha by a voice vote despite lacking the numbers, what stops the new laws? The President is not likely to withhold assent or send the Bills back except granting an audience. Even if he were to do so hypothetically, they would be passed again, with or without any amendments, as the ruling BJP has an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha and has already set a precedent of passing debatable Bills by voice vote without discussion, deliberation or consensus. Besides, the President is not bound to act within a time-frame. And the way more Bills were passed even as the entire Opposition stayed away from the House in protest, it looks like the ruling party has no compunction in reducing an august institution to a stamping authority. So Opposition members can speak and cry hoarse all they want but cannot seek solace in parliamentary procedure or vetting by committees to stop motivated laws from being enacted. And when it comes to street fights, last year?s general elections showed us how the members of the grand anti-BJP alliance frittered away their best intentions to their selfish, regional interests. Till that cohesiveness congeals as a single movement, there cannot be any hope for the Opposition.

Worryingly, the Upper House passed three key labour reform bills that ought to have been discussed and debated given their sensitive nature. The Government has enough numbers in the Lok Sabha to override dialogue and even if outnumbered in the Rajya Sabha, it knows it can hijack debate by provoking the Opposition enough and use a voice vote in the resultant din. Or simply take advantage of a boycott. The three Bills relate to new labour codes on industrial relations, social security and occupational safety, all in the name of easing business while diluting workers? rights. Nobody expects the Government to be unreasonably welfarist but in a post-pandemic economy that has witnessed record joblessness, it allows companies with up to 300 workers to fire staff without government permission. The Government, however, feels that this would actually encourage employers to hire more than the previous limit of 100 and, in fact, create jobs. But employers in stressed times are hardly expected to be altruistic and given that our unorganised labourers comprise a big chunk of the country?s workforce, they continue to be exposed to vagaries of market forces. The Rajya Sabha also passed the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020, which ostensibly provides a framework under which organisations in India can receive and utilise grants from foreign sources. This is an umbrella watch on what is unsuitable to this Government the most, namely NGOs, research organisations, think tanks and civil society activists. And the carefully enunciated regulatory mechanism envisaged by the Bill, of course, remains vague about the conditions under which it can be used, lumping them as anything that is detrimental to ?national interest.? Nobody denies the need for greater transparency when it comes to activities sponsored by foreign sources but would that also be used to vet the PM Cares Fund, which is currently exempted under FCRA, or selectively be applied to ?anti-national? NGOs? Or does the Government believe that NGOs shouldn?t exist to point out gaps in its policies and implementation? Besides, most of these organisations have a high record of tax compliances over the years but by making Aadhar and SBI bank accounts mandatory for receipts, the Bill implies tighter controls and increased transaction costs, which are meant to create more impediments. This is just a way to stifle and discourage independent voices than a clean-up as is being proposed. It is the same kind of doublespeak that is latent in the farm Bills. On the face of it, they look reformist, dismantling the heavily cartelised Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and middlemen, and allowing farmers freedom of movement and trade. Question is some of them do not have the investable resources or the expertise for an outreach beyond their geographic limits and would have to depend on ?traders? or the corporations. The smaller and marginal farmers are not literate or educated enough and would not be able to counter the heft of corporations in negotiations and price fixing. In that sense, they could still end up being exploited as before. The farmers fear that in an open, competitive market, they would not get the minimum support price (MSP) that the Government promises to continue and given the diversity and multiplicity of markets, the guaranteed official procurement would be hit over time. Besides, nowhere do the Bills insist on the MSP as a criterion of farm pick-ups by ?traders? and ?sponsors.? They would, therefore, still be in crisis and at the mercy of the dictates of marketers. Besides, the proposed laws are still vague on defining the mechanisms that would replace the regulated economy. This kind of obfuscation has become so familiar that it is in danger of becoming the norm than the exception. And without Question Hour in Parliament, it?s time the questions are asked on the streets. The farmers? ire may just be the beginning of the next electoral plank.",Opp conundrum,The Pioneer,UPA
18,Farm Bill,"On Sunday, the Rajya Sabha passed The Farmers? Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. This newspaper has supported the government?s efforts to bring about a new legislative and policy architecture for agriculture as a method to empower farmers. But as far as legislation is concerned, there is both content and process. And on Sunday, there is little doubt that the process was undermined, reflecting poorly on India?s parliamentary democracy.

The reforms are significant, affecting a range of stakeholders, particularly farmers. They have also generated a political backlash, with even partners in the ruling coalition such as the Shiromani Akali Dal resigning from the Cabinet on the issue. The Opposition was keen on sending the bills to a select committee. Ideally, this should be done ? for the committee process provides an opportunity to examine legislation, refine it, and allows parliamentarians to speak up without being confined to party positions. But if the government was not willing to embark on that process, there should have been a discussion in the House where members got a chance to offer their perspectives and the government listened to feedback and made modifications accordingly. And along with this, there should have been a clear voting process ? a division as it is called in parliamentary parlance ? to get an accurate sense of the mood of the House.

Unfortunately, none of this was done. The discussion in the House was rushed ? since the government wants to push through other legislations quickly, before the session is brought to an early end. And there was no division, but a voice vote ? prompting genuine questions about whether the government had the numbers at all. So it was with one eye on the clock and another eye on the numbers that the government rushed through the process on Sunday ? but this was wrong.

The Opposition was wrong too ? in being disruptive, creating a din, tearing documents, and creating a difficult situation for the presiding officer, perhaps indicating that it too was not confident of the numbers. The responsibility for what happened on Sunday rests with both sides. The government?s victory in getting the bills passed will be tainted by the way it was done, and the Opposition?s response will dilute its legitimate right to protest.",The govt?s rush to pass key farm bills and the Opposition?s conduct were wrong,The Hindustan Times,Neutral
19,Farm Bill,"This is one more instance where the Centre has cocked a snook at the whole concept of cooperative federalism
A furious debate has broken out in the political salons of Delhi, corporate boardrooms and the farmlands of the country over the latest wave of reforms that the Narendra Modi government has unleashed with a stack of legislations that professes to free farmers from the tyranny of over 2,000 corruption-ridden wholesale markets where middlemen have robbed them blind for decades. The three pieces of legislation passed in the Lok Sabha have created a framework designed to usher in contract farming in a big way, catalyse the creation of large cold chain storage facilities and logistic networks, and shake off stockholding restrictions that were designed for an era of shortages. The broad contours of the reforms have a seductive appeal: they will remove the fetters on the farmers by giving them the opportunity to plug into a barrier-free common market for agriculture produce. They will ostensibly allow them to secure a fair price without having to worry about an unsold crop and wastage.

But the big beef over the reforms is that they have been introduced without any consultative process with the states or the various stakeholders. This is one more instance where the Centre has cocked a snook at the whole concept of cooperative federalism. Agriculture is a state subject, and the states have exercised a measure of control over farm supplies. That is now being broken and replaced by a system where the levers of control will pass to large business houses, which can now buy farm produce in bulk directly from the farmers and not worry about any stockholding restrictions. This could have a huge impact on price discovery and it is hard to say just yet whether it will deliver the desired outcomes.

The Centre has tried to sell the idea of reforms by suggesting that the new laws would ensure that farmers will be paid for their produce within three days of the sale ? an assurance that the old mandi system could never provide. But questions have rightly been raised about the inadequacy of the dispute resolution mechanism in protecting farmers? interests in an unequal battle with large corporates. The powers of dispute resolution have been delegated to magistrates and district collectors rather than specially designed agriculture tribunals. There remains a legitimate fear that the entire reform process is a thinly-disguised plan to favour a few crony capitalists while professing to create a brave new world for farmers. The objective is noble and may work in theory but it could well flounder in practice. There is a great danger that New India might be trading in an old, home-grown wheeler-dealer network for a new, swashbuckling bunch of buccaneers, leaving the farmer just as destitute as he is now.",Farms in ferment: Parliament passes farmer bills,The Telegraph,

21,Pradhan Mantri Jandhan Yojna,"In rural areas 44 per cent of the households and in urban areas 33 per cent of them still do not have a bank account.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, a major socio-economic initiative of the National Democratic Alliance government, was announced by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day speech. It is an ambitious attempt at extending formal financial services in a country where only 58.7 per cent of an estimated 24.67 crore households avail themselves of banking services. Despite several steps taken by many governments over the years, financial inclusion has remained elusive. In rural areas 44 per cent of the households and in urban areas 33 per cent of them still do not have a bank account. The NDA government has brought a degree of urgency to the scheme of financial inclusion. A few details of the government?s action plan figured in the budget speech. A Comprehensive Financial Inclusion Plan (CFIP) envisaging coverage of excluded households has been drawn up and is expected to be rolled out under the nomenclature. In its first phase, the Jan-Dhan Yojana will endeavour to provide universal access to all the beneficiaries through sub-service areas (SSA), each of them consisting of 100-150 families in a cluster of villages. Each SSA will be serviced by a business correspondent, who is now being given a pivotal role in facilitating account opening and ensuring smooth bank operations. Unlike in previous action plans, the Jan-Dhan Yojana will have as its focus households rather than geographical areas.

The other important innovation is in extending need-based credit facilities to the new account holders upon their fulfilling certain conditions. A smart card ? the Ru Pay card ? will be issued. Using this it should be possible for customers to operate their accounts without any external help. This would be one of the most visible manifestations of technology as a tool to further inclusion, others being money transfers through mobile telephones, e-KYCs and cash management by banks to extend their services over such wide areas. Insurance companies will be asked to offer micro-finance packages including insurance. Obviously there are major challenges. Even if operational obstacles can be overcome, there is the important question of keeping the first-time bank account holders engaged. Experience suggests that a high proportion of such accounts are hardly used after the initial enthusiasm wears off. The plan of inclusion, which is part of the Prime Minister?s vision of a Digital India, requires all-round support. The government wants to use these accounts for routing cash transfers in lieu of subsidies for essential commodities. Financial inclusion in that sense is therefore much more than extending banking services. Accompanied by an equally ambitious programme of spreading financial literacy, it can achieve many important socio-economic objectives.",An ambitious plan for inclusion,The Hindu,

31,CAA,"The Centre must stop privileging religious persecution over other forms
As protests continue to ripple in many parts of the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or the CAA, the National Population Register (NPR) and allied issues, their nature, content and direction have drawn critical attention. The introduction of a religious test for Indian citizenship through the CAA evoked widespread public indignation. Right-thinking people from all walks of life mobilised in a manner befitting a vibrant democracy, and several State governments and Assemblies have expressed reservations. Students have been in the forefront of protests that marked an awakening from a defeatist slumber of the country in the face of creeping majoritarianism. As the protests linger on, however, they appear to be sliding into the control of vested interests that work for religious polarisation. The discriminatory CAA targets Muslims, but the protests were driven by the wider civil society at the beginning. Incendiary speeches and slogans at anti-CAA protests, and even support for Islamist politics, have put non-sectarian opponents of the law in a difficult spot. Muslims have equal rights as all other citizens of India to assemble and protest, but reducing the CAA debate into a question of their rights alone is dishonour of the pluralist, inclusive Constitution of secular India. After the success in kindling a national debate on the issue which is now before the Supreme Court that will litigate its constitutionality, anti-CAA protesters must now hold their fire.

The opportunity that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sniffed in the protests is not to reach out and reconcile, but to confront and polarise, particularly in the campaign for the Delhi Assembly election. The chilling effect of the party?s brazen vilification and dehumanisation of the protesters is no longer an abstract fear. Three separate incidents of firing at protesters, two clearly inspired by Hindutva politics, have been reported in Delhi. Far from condemning these incidents in the strongest terms and ensuring swift and strict police action, the BJP leadership has continued with divisive rhetoric. A Union Minister led slogans calling for the ?shooting of traitors?. The BJP must immediately adopt a path of reconciliation and resolution. One way is by making a further amendment to the CAA that will not prioritise religious persecution over other forms of persecution. No protester is against welcoming the persecuted from three neighbouring countries listed in the CAA. By amending the law to remove the arbitrary selection of countries and religious groups, the current turmoil can be easily calmed. A small step of reason and vision will serve India well.",Need of the hour: On CAA protests,The Hindu,
32,CAA,"Amid unending turmoil over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens, Centre has sanctioned funds for the National Population Register exercise with the explicit promise that it is not linked to the divisive NRC. Rhetoric on NRC has been dialled down, but the relief has proved short lived with NPR sparking fresh worries. For one, the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, leave little to imagination that a Population Register could be a precursor to finalising a ?National Register of Indian Citizens?.

Equally alarming are the 2003 rules which allow anyone to raise objections to entries in the ?Local Register of Indian Citizens? at the taluk/ sub-district level. It raises the prospect of genuine citizens in a document-poor country like India being subjected to harassment and witch hunts from neighbours, politically motivated groups, and a dysfunctional lower bureaucracy.

BJP looks out on a limb with this one, as it finds it difficult to convince even its allies, let alone the opposition, that all these enumeration exercises in conjunction with CAA will do more good than harm. Akali Dal now wants Muslim refugees also included in CAA after supporting the legislation in Parliament. Similarly, Assam?s AGP supported CAA in Parliament but is now singing a different tune. Others like JD(U) and BJD, which also supported CAA, are pushing back against NRC. All these parties were mum earlier, despite CAA-NRC?s discriminatory and bureaucratic character as well as NRC?s apparent failure in Assam having been pointed out. While they should have exercised due diligence, BJP should now pay heed and listen to the protesting voices.

But that isn?t happening yet going by Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s rebuke of the violent protests and unqualified backing for UP police. Videos of the violence implicate both sides. With police constraining the space for peaceful protests the danger of grievances manifesting as violence grows. Acts like booking 1,200 people at Aligarh Muslim University for a candlelight protest mustn?t be repeated. 21 shooting deaths in UP alone are excessive. Many states have said they will not cooperate in these enumeration exercises. A gaping trust deficit is accompanying the gathering storm and it portends misery, chaos and economic ruin.

34,CAA,"The people of India have spoken up ? they will not allow the constitution to be subverted.

For weeks now, Indians have come out on the streets in unprecedented numbers. Not a single protestor is opposed to the grant of citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Instead they have declared in unison that religion cannot be a criterion for the grant of citizenship. Whatever the government says, that is precisely what the Citizenship (Amendment) Act does.

The prime minister has claimed that the National Register of Citizens ? which will divide Indians into ?citizens? and ?doubtful citizens? ? is not even at the discussion stage in official circles. His assurance is completely contradicted by home minister Amit Shah?s statements inside Parliament and outside that the exercise will be rolled out all over the country by 2024. Meanwhile, a renewed push is being made for the National Population Register (NPR), which has no raison d?etre except to serve as a data bank for the NRC.

The issue, however, is not that the two top-most government figures are saying opposing things. Nor should Modi?s word on this be considered final. It is a government?s responsibility to show the country a clear, consistent and consultative legal framework for any policy on this order of significance. Instead it continuously shifts, contradicts, denies its own claims ? broad and detailed ? and has only confirmed popular fears of its bad faith. As a result, only the formal withdrawal of the all-India NRC as a concept can assure the country that this horrendous exercise will not be taken up in the future.

Civil society and the public and large have understood this. That is why the protests have not slowed, and even the violence by the police in different parts of the country ? mainly in BJP-ruled states ? has not deterred citizens from coming out on the streets. Their principal demand is that the CAA be redrafted to offer citizenship to any bona fide refugee facing persecution in India?s neighbourhood. This simple redrafting will adequately cover refugees from the six communities the government says it is concerned about, without gratuitously listing them (and excluding others) in the text of the law. The fact that Modi and Shah are tone deaf to this elementary logic is proof that their aim is to polarise the country on religious lines and drag India further towards a ?Hindu rashtra?.

The illegal manner in which people have been denied the right to peacefully oppose the government?s move ? the misuse of Section 144, detentions and beatings, internet shutdowns ? has widened the ambit of the protests, which are no longer just about the CAA and NRC. In fact, the hundreds of thousands of citizens out on the streets, braving lathis and bullets, chanting slogans and singing songs and vociferously raising their voice against the government, are now fighting for the constitution, for India?s foundational principles, for their democratic rights.

From Assam to Kerala, from Mumbai to Kolkata and in Delhi, Lucknow and Mangalore, Kasargode, Vijayawada and Aurangabad, Indians, young and old, cutting across religion and caste, have come out to let the government know that they will not stay silent in the face of a brazen attempt to ride roughshod over India?s democracy.

For the past six years or so, the country has seen lynchings, rising intolerance and systematic attempts at silencing critics. Institutions of higher learning are under siege. Minority rights are under attack. The completely cynical way in which a long-standing arrangement with Kashmir has been subverted and an entire people suppressed has shocked the conscience of the world. Barring some voices of protest, however, many in India have remained quiet, mostly because they were too scared to speak out.

The CAA-NPR-NRC threat has changed all that. While the BJP privately tells its supporters that this ?trishul? is aimed at Muslims alone, the fact is that millions of Indian citizens are likely to have their lives upended by the party?s insistence that they prove their citizenship. As of today, the government has still not decided what the metric will be, but given bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption and sheer cussedness, ?mistakes? are bound to happen on a large scale. The list of ?doubtful citizens? that this enumerative excess eventually produces will almost entirely comprise the poor. Minorities will be the worst affected, because of the intent behind the exercise, but other marginalised sections will not be far behind.

The Modi government must read the public mood and step back. People do not want vague assurances any more. Nothing short of the complete scrapping of the NPR and NRC and the redrafting of the CAA to bring it in conformity with India?s constitutional principles and international law obligations will do.","The Protests are Not Just Anti-CAA, But Pro-Constitution",The Wire,
35,CAA,"The agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act appears to have gone through three phases. In the first phase, it was a protest against its enactment, as there were genuine apprehensions that the Act, followed by a pan-India NRC exercise, would lead to a large section of society, mostly Muslims, being declared illegal migrants/citizens. There was protests in Jamia Millia Islamia and large-scale demonstrations in Assam and other Northeast states. In the second phase, it became a confrontation between students and the police. Allegations of police high-handedness spread and there were sympathetic protests in educational institutions across the country. The CAA remained the trigger, but it was pushed to the background. Student anger was directed against the police and the government. In the third phase, which we are witnessing today, the movement has been hijacked by political opportunists, separatist factions, fundamentalist groups and lumpen elements. The CAA is an excuse; the target is the ruling party.

The government, in retrospect, appears to have seriously miscalculated the fallout of the CAA. Its success on three fronts appears to have made it insensitive to the simmering anger among the Muslim community. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which banned triple talaq, was a good measure for the emancipation of Muslim women from an atrocious practice, but it antagonised the radical elements. The abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, aggravated the discomfiture of Muslims. Then the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya added to the sense of unease. The canard that the judiciary had been influenced to give the disputed plot to the Hindus for the construction of the Ram temple, with some luminaries writing about the alleged flaws in the judgment, added fuel to the fire. All these three developments ? the annulment of triple talaq, the abrogation of Article 370 and the Ayodhya verdict ? collectively led to a feeling of anger, resentment and frustration among Muslims. The government either was not aware of the depth of Muslim resentment or was not bothered about it and was confident of being able to weather any storm.

The announcement of the National Population Register was unexceptionable, but it was ill-timed. Heavens would not have fallen if it had been delayed by a few months. It has provided further ammunition to the Opposition which has embarked on a disinformation campaign to mislead people.


The police are presently doing a thankless job. If they take action against the agitators, as they did in UP, there are allegations of high-handedness. If they play it safe, as they did in West Bengal, the agitators will have a field day ? destroy railway property, burn buses, attack police posts and indulge in acts of vandalism. It is indeed sad that in most of the states, the governments are not particularly bothered about the destruction of public and private property. The taxpayer?s money is nobody?s concern.

The Supreme Court had, in the context of state governments not taking effective measures to protect public and private property from being damaged by unruly mobs, constituted two committees, one headed by Justice K T Thomas and the other by F S Nariman, to study the problem. The Thomas Committee gave recommendations regarding the modalities for preventive action and for providing sharper teeth to inquiry/investigation. The Nariman Committee made suggestions regarding the assessment of damages. These were accepted by the Court which clearly said that ?the liability will be borne by the actual perpetrators of the crime as well as the organisers of the event giving rise to the liability? and that ?exemplary damages may be awarded?. Uttar Pradesh is perhaps the first state to have shown the political will to punish those who vandalised property.

The agitation has thrown up some disturbing questions. In UP, according to the police chief, there was a conspiracy to create disturbance. If so, one would like to know its full ramifications. Another senior police officer said that the pattern of protests in the state showed guerrilla tactics. The official version that the police did not open fire, and the fact that there have been deaths due to bullet injuries need to be reconciled. Reports about the involvement of Popular Front of India (PFI) in the agitation are a matter of grave concern and require in-depth investigation. The Karnataka home minister, speaking about the Mangaluru violence, stated that the attack on police was premeditated and the arson was orchestrated by anti-social elements. It would appear that the roots of the agitation go much deeper. Resentment against CAA was perhaps the proverbial last straw. But the movement has since degenerated into a confrontation between the government and diverse elements opposed to it.

The objections to the Citizenship Act are generally unconvincing. Assam is the only state which has reasons to feel aggrieved. There is substance in the argument that the Act contravenes Clause 6 of the Assam Accord which guaranteed safeguards to ?protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people?. Reservations on the NRC are understandable. While going ahead with the CAA, the government would do well to scrap the proposal to expand the NRC and explore the possibility of settling refugees in other states across the country which are willing to and in a position to absorb them.",The objections to the Citizenship Act are generally unconvincing,The Indian Express,
36,CAA,"As the year ends, by snatching Jharkhand from the BJP?s command, the Congress is probably having the last laugh. Anti-BJP protests and demonstrations across the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) have certainly punctured the larger-than-life image projected about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It has deflated electorally also in Jharkhand. Hopefully, the Jharkhand results will not make the Congress over-confident about its prospects in the forthcoming Assembly elections, particularly in Delhi. At present, the party needs to pay strategic importance to its anti-BJP campaign even if this demands an alliance with a regional party. Regarding Jharkhand, the Congress acted shrewdly by allying with a regional party prior to the Assembly elections than choosing to deliberate on its options after the declaration of the results. Besides, its protests against the CAA and the NRC has apparently not been ignored by voters.

Amit Shah needs to perhaps deliberate on his confidence about remaining in power for 50 years because of the 2019 parliamentary victory. One needs to view his 50-year ?obsession? from another angle. He may be around, but there is no guarantee that he?d still be in power.

There is also a severe temporal lapse in the BJP?s drafting of the NRC as well as the CAA. The selection of the year 1971 for registering citizens in keeping with the NRC, which has so far not extended beyond Assam, is fairly puzzling. The framers of the NRC presumed that they will take little time in implementing it beyond Assam. India is not Assam, nor is it just Gujarat or Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).

Some importance should also be given to this nation?s functioning in keeping with its Indian Standard Time. Everything does not get done in time here. So, I am wondering, by the time some designated officials land up at the houses of those born before 1971, on the basis of God knows which data, there is no guarantee that those persons would be around. Okay, digital technology is assumed to have made everything a lot faster. But it was not around in the 1970s and earlier. How will midwives (dais) responsible for the birth of many prior to the 1970s be traced? Also, I have not heard of midwives having kept any record of the births they assisted in. With respect to those born in hospitals prior to 1971, the possibility of their certificates being retrieved from there is as good as non-existent. Besides, there is the ?name? issue.

Nowadays, even a minor difference in spelling of names in various identity cards one is supposed to have can spell a major headache. Earlier, usually, only nicknames were decided at the time of birth. The birth certificates of many, if they exist, prior to the 1970s don?t have the same name which was later chosen formally. Most educated and urban Indians are at present loaded with too many identity cards and documents required for verification: Driving license, birth-certificate, educational certificates, passport, PAN card, bank-statement, proof of having paid income tax, voter-ID and of course the Aadhaar card. The last needs to be linked with registered mobile numbers, PAN cards, bank accounts and I am not aware if new rules would include some other documents, including verification by neighbours with documents to prove their identity.

It is really mind-boggling as to how many more identity cards each Indian is likely to be commanded to have. When Aadhaar cards were made compulsory, we ensured that all family members got theirs, by using the services of private agents. Since an elderly member was bedridden, the agent came home for his photograph, fingerprints, etc and his card was made. Earlier, the concerned government unit was approached to facilitate the same service. It took more than a year to respond and got in touch with us after the member had expired. This is just a mild indicator of the lapses still prevalent in the Indian system, because of which it is impossible to expect immediate, accurate as well as complete data to be officially recorded about each and every citizen.

This writer has also learnt of cases of the Aadhaar card displaying the incorrect gender. No person ? male, female, transgender or of any gender ? would like to be identified wrongly, gender-wise. Of course, these errors have been corrected but not instantly or just within a few days.

Even if the present leaders remain confident about the NRC and the CAA being prepared in 50 years, as per IST, why don?t they look into the future; and start keeping records from 2020 than waste money and time in digging up the past?

It may be wiser for the government to give some importance to keeping a record of the blood group of each citizen. It should. It must. This will save time when, God forbid, any person reaches the stage of needing blood supply. Blood group is not decided by race, religion, caste, class and/or any other ethnic division. All my family members have different blood groups. Being accident-prone, they have needed blood more than once. Who knows, which and how many Indian citizens? blood flows through my veins? I just know that it is Indian. Only in films, siblings with the same blood group turn up to save their parent from the jaws of death and thus get reunited.

The unity being voiced by Indians against the CAA and the NRC cannot be taken lightly. It is a wake-up call for all, including ones obsessed by a 50-year syndrome. And this is not a laughing matter. The new generation is charting a new chapter for the coming years!",CAA & NRC are a wake-up call for all Indians,Deccan Chronicle,
37,CAA,"The Muslim community, in short, viewed the course of politics since 2014 as a series of defeats. Determination to reacquire political relevance found expression in the anti-CAA stir, aided and abetted by those who had other political scores to settle with the Modi Government

There are two very conflicting versions of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act movement that are doing the rounds. Both need dispassionate scrutiny if we are to anticipate the future trends in Indian politics.

The first narrative would have us believe that the anti-CAA stir is essentially an uprising of civil society against a bid by the Narendra Modi Government to steer India towards a majoritarian state. According to this point of view, the CAA may seem innocuous at first glance but in effect prepares the groundwork for relegating Muslims to the status of second-class citizens. Although the way this argument has been translated into political messaging in the grassroots would suggest that Indian Muslims must henceforth prove their Indian citizenship with documentation, the more sophisticated of the anti-CAA concede that there is nothing in the laws for the state to undertake such a draconian exercise. Their contention is that it could happen and a pre-emptive strike to negate all discriminatory practices is imperative.

The second feature of this narrative is that the anti-CAA stir is presented as an uprising of civil society and includes a wide cross-section of society. In particular, it is held that students, Dalit organisations and all minority communities are involved in defeating the Modi Government?s project. It is also being held that the CAA is against the tenets of the Constitution and will be struck down by the Supreme Court after the hearings resume in April.

Initially, the parliamentary opposition was slow to react to the CAA. The hearings of the Select Committee weren?t marked by too much acrimony ? although dissenting notes were submitted. The Opposition believed that the main opposition to the CAA would happen in Assam and the North-eastern States and would be linked to the pre-existing disquiet against outsiders and all foreigners ? Hindus and Muslims. The Opposition felt that the real pressure on the Government would come from these areas and that the rest of the country would be largely unaffected. Certainly, there was no anticipation that the Muslim community would react so adversely to a legislation that was aimed at benefitting small communities of refugees. In hindsight, the Opposition has merely piggy-backed on a movement that has been initiated and nurtured by community organisations.

The alternative narrative presented by the Modi Government sees the CAA as attending to a long-standing issue centred on the loose ends of Partition. It has proceeded on the assumption that while illegal immigration from Bangladesh is difficult to contain, the issue would become more manageable and politically rewarding if a distinction could be made between refugees who had fled from religious persecution and those who had entered India for other regions. If the refugees were driven by a push factor, the infiltrators were pulled towards India by economic considerations.

Underlying this distinction between refugees and infiltrators was the unstated conviction that India was the natural homeland for all Hindus. The CAA, in effect, guaranteed a right of return to all Hindus of the subcontinent. Coming to the anti-CAA stir, the Government too was taken by surprise when Muslim protests erupted all over West Bengal on December 13 ? two days after Parliament passed the Bill ? and quickly spread to the Muslim-dominated campuses of Aligarh and Jamia Milia Islamia, Delhi. Hostile demonstrations were anticipated in Assam and the North-eastern States and the Government was prepared to meet these with a combination of persuasion and firmness. There does not appear to have been any corresponding strategy for the protests in the rest of India. Once the protests escalated, the narrative of the BJP and the Government shifted focus to the composition of the protests. The Government was always clear in its mind on two things.

First, that the composition of the demonstrations and the geography of the protests clearly indicated that it was a pre-planned Muslim uprising.

Secondly, it was also felt that the CAA was incidental to the protests. The Muslim community, it was felt, was smarting over the fact that in two successive general elections, the BJP and Narendra Modi had coasted to outright victory without any Muslim support. Modi had not only undermined the political clout of the Muslim community; he had added to the insult by enacting three laws that many Muslims felt were inimical to their community interests. The first was the triple talaq legislation, the first time Muslim personal laws were altered since 1940. The second was the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, a long-standing BJP election commitment that the pundits felt could never be implemented. Thirdly, there was the CAA which clearly distinguished between Hindu refugees and Muslim infiltrators. In principle, by stating that those who were deemed illegal immigrants were ineligible for citizenship, the CAA has left the door open for deportation of foreigners. The CAA also ruled out the possibility of India granting any form of asylum to Muslim Rohingyas fleeing Bangladesh. Finally, the simmering disquiet over the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case was waiting to find an outlet.

The Muslim community, in short, viewed the course of politics since 2014 as a series of defeats. The determination to reacquire political relevance found expression in the anti-CAA stir, aided and abetted by those who had other political scores to settle with the Modi Government.

What is being witnessed in today?s India is a sharply polarised environment based on two very different narratives. India is actually witnessing a sharply ideological division which won?t easily be resolved.  ",CAA protest is Muslims' pent-up ire against Modi,The Pioneer,
38,CAA,"The European Union (EU) Parliament is set to debate a clutch of resolutions on various policies of the Narendra Modi government, ranging from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) to the changes to Article 370. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government?s ideological push has generated domestic challenges, be it in the form of sullen anger among locals in Kashmir or the protests against the CAA. But it has also generated a major international challenge, with criticism about the weakening of democracy in India.

To be sure, the EU Parliament does not reflect the will of the independent, sovereign governments that make up the Union. Additionally, the resolutions and statements by Members of the European Parliament lack any binding authority. It is also true that India?s external adversaries, and ideologically driven groups, have often pushed exaggerated propaganda. And there can be no arguing that the issues that are discussed are India?s business. But the onus rests on Delhi to allay apprehensions. It cannot play up foreign points of view when favourable (remember it invited MEPs to Kashmir), and dismiss them as irrelevant when unfavourable.

39,CAA,"The Union law minister has assured the nation that while there is a possibility of the National Register of Citizens being implemented, it would be done on the basis of rules defined after exhaustive consultation. If the sustained protests across the country against the NRC as well as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are any indication, India?s citizens remain deeply suspicious about the real intent of these measures. The contentious nature of the CAA, which seeks to redefine citizenship through a selective filter of faith, is one reason for the public outrage. The mixed signals coming from the top have also helped fan the flames. Earlier, the prime minister had said that talks of a pan-India NRC have not taken place. Narendra Modi, who seemed to be contradicting the views of his colleagues, including the home minister, is now, in turn, being contradicted by the Union law minister. If the claim of talks of a countrywide NRC, as Mr Modi said, is indeed speculative, how is it that the Union law minister spotted the ?possibility? of the NRC being imposed on the nation at some point?

Perhaps this is all a part of the Bharatiya Janata Party?s game plan. A smokescreen, the result of inconsistent pronouncements, is often useful to mask intent. It is the discriminatory nature of the CAA-NRC that makes such subterfuge necessary. The proposal is not just unconstitutional: providing citizenship on the basis of religion goes against constitutional tenets. What is equally objectionable ? this point seems to have got lost amidst the noise ? is that the NRC, the CAA cannot be looked at independently, proposes to shift the burden of proof of citizenship on citizens themselves. Why should Indians, most of whom possess relevant documentary evidence of some form, be made to experience the indignity of having to declare their place in the country to a government that has been elected by them? This is an inversion of the basic contract that binds citizens to their government. Yet, the BJP is convinced that electoral majority has given it the licence to subject the people, rather than its government, to tests of fidelity to citizenship or, as the disastrous demonetization exercise showed, to financial integrity. Ideally, in a democracy, the people are invested with the power to hold the government accountable. But in New India, it is the government that is attempting to render the people powerless in this respect.","NRC, CAA talk all upside down",The Telegraph,

41,Rafale Deal,"The price-redacted audit report on the process to acquire 36 Rafale fighter jets is unlikely to bring closure to the controversy over the deal. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India tabled in Parliament comes in the midst of a vigorous campaign by the Opposition that is questioning the process, based on media revelations about possible lapses and deviations and significant points raised by dissenting members of the Indian Negotiating Team (INT). The Modi government can draw comfort from the fact that the CAG report concludes that the 2016 agreement is slightly better in terms of both pricing and delivery than what was under negotiation in 2007 during the UPA regime. However, the report does not allay all doubts. Pegged at 2.86%, the price advantage in the contract over the 2007 offer is marginal. It is a far cry from the 9% saving claimed by the government. The delivery schedule is only one month sooner than the estimated outer limit in the earlier process. The CAG has found fault with Dassault Aviation being allowed to retain the gains made by the absence of a bank guarantee, which, if executed, would have come with significant charges. Disappointingly, the CAG has not quantified this amount, though it declares that it should have been passed on to the Defence Ministry. The 2007 price offered by Dassault included bank charges, and its absence in the 2016 contract is a clear benefit to the company. In other words, the ?advantage? is lower than the 2.86%.

While the key question of pricing is sought to be resolved by the CAG by comparing the auditors? aligned price with the INT?s computation, some issues remain unaddressed. The original issue of bringing down the total acquisition from 126 to 36 aircraft does not draw much comment. Also, the huge outgo on the India-Specific Enhancements (ISEs), despite the final figure being projected as a 17% saving on the aligned offer, is something that requires deeper examination. While auditing the earlier process, the CAG found that ISEs were upgrades allowed to be made so that Dassault?s bid would be compliant with qualitative requirements. Even a team of Ministry officials that examined in March 2015 the integrity of the earlier process concluded that ?the acceptance of [Dassault?s] additional commercial proposal after bid submission date... was unprecedented and against the canons of financial propriety.? Dassault was not the lowest bidder in the earlier process, and its technical bid had been rejected. Perhaps, this presented an opportunity to the present regime to reopen the entire process to buy Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) and invite fresh bids. However, it chose the IGA route with France, possibly for diplomatic reasons. The CAG identifies as a major problem the fact that the technical requirements are too narrowly defined for most vendors to comply with. The message from the report is that defence acquisition processes require reforms and streamlining.",The CAG report does not allay all doubts about the Rafale deal,The Hindu,
42,Rafale Deal,"With the tabling of the Comptroller and Auditor General?s (CAG) report on the Rafale fighter aircraft deal in Parliament, both BJP and Congress are claiming vindication. While the ruling party is pointing to the report?s finding that the fighter jet deal negotiated by it in 2016 was 2.86% cheaper ? per unit basis ? than the 2007 deal for the same aircraft that was being negotiated by the previous UPA regime, Congress is still hinting at impropriety because the report redacts the actual prices of the aircraft and associated components.

In fact, CAG itself finds comparing the two deals ? UPA?s 126 aircraft and NDA?s 36 aircraft ? quite challenging. Not only were the quantities different, the auditor also had to factor in price escalation over the intervening years as well as differences in the packages themselves. UPA?s 126 aircraft deal had a significant transfer-of-technology component unlike NDA?s 36 aircraft in flyaway condition. Nonetheless, the CAG report lays out the reasons for the cancellation of the UPA deal as Rafale?s French manufacturer Dassault Aviation refusing to provide guarantee for the aircraft that were to be produced by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and failure to determine the manpower cost of manufacturing in India. This setback after a 15-year procurement process had created a real crisis for the Indian Air Force whose fighter squadrons are fast depleting.

But BJP may have scored a self-goal when it declared after coming to power that it would get a better fighter aircraft deal. As the CAG report shows, three items of the new Rafale deal including the basic aircraft were procured at the same price as the old deal. It also indicates that the marginal price drop overall happened at the cost of removal of banking and performance guarantees, a standard feature of such contracts. Congress is bound to play this up, and political fisticuffs will continue.

On several matters, the Narendra Modi government has failed to answer the opposition?s questions clearly and unequivocally. To cite one of very many, why can?t the price of the Rafale jet be revealed to a select parliamentary panel, especially as estimates are widely available and cannot be tough to find out for anyone determined to dig? Opacity in the government?s arguments has enabled the opposition to look for advantage. Finally, if this is the tortuous path that every defence procurement has to take, it is a tragedy. A better defence procurement process needs to be worked out expeditiously for the sake of national security.","CAG?s Rafale report: Political fisticuffs will continue, India?s defence procurement is in a mess",The times of India,

Earlier court directions had to do with the selection process, but more searching questions are now being asked, mainly on two issues: pricing and the offset deal between Dassault and an Indian private player. The government might take cover under the Officials Secrets Act on not disclosing the pricing of a deal already being fulfilled by India with the first payment made to Dassault. It would, however, be in everyone?s interest for the Centre to be more forthcoming on the deal than it has been ? in Parliament and in the Supreme Court.

48,Rafale Deal,"There?s no such thing as a benign Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report. The government?s auditor is expected to be finicky and puritanical when it comes to processes and finances ? and it is usually that. The report by CAG on the Indian Air Force?s acquisitions that was tabled in Parliament on February 13, is just that, although not in a way that either the government or the opposition would want. The report is on 11 air force purchases, although much of the focus has been on one deal ? the purchase of 36 Rafale fighters through an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) between India and France.

At one level, the report on Rafale, is a vindication of the government?s stance that it bought the aircraft at a lower price than in an older deal negotiated by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), and scrapped in March 2015. At another, by highlighting the absence, in the new deal, of financial and performance guarantees on around 25% of the cost of the old deal, the government?s auditor has explicitly articulated its point of view that Rafale maker Dassault Aviation has saved some amount of money and not passed it on to the government of India. This, the fact that the offsets part of the deal will only be dealt with in a subsequent report, and the report?s mere restatement of the government?s position on the lack of financial and performance guarantees in the new deal will likely provide enough material for the Congress and other parties to continue to ask questions about the deal. The big message in the CAG report, though, isn?t any of this. Anyone reading the report cannot but be appalled at the way the defence procurement process works in India. It is, at best, inefficient, and at worst, opaque.

Sample this: the government spent four years, between 2000, when it first set out to buy the much-needed fighter jets, and 2004, deciding whether the purchase should be done on a so-called single-source basis or through a competitive bid. The government in charge was the first edition of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Or this: in November 2004, having decided to opt for the competitive bidding route, the government put out a Request for Interest. The CAG report says the only thing this contributed to the process was a delay. Sure enough, the Request for Quotations didn?t go out till August 2007. The government of the day? The first edition of the UPA. The bureaucracy and the defence establishment seem to have done their bit too. The CAG report is especially harsh on the narrow definition of Air Staff Qualitative Standards or ASQRs, and the arrival of the benchmark price, which seems to be without basis ? a committee under UPA-1 came up with a price 47% lower than the lowest bid in the case of the old deal; the Indian negotiation team for the IGA under the NDA, started with one that was 57% lower. The CAG terms both prices unrealistic.

In what must cause discomfort to the UPA, the report says Dassault was treated preferentially in the old deal. Indeed, the fighter didn?t meet nine of the ASQRs; the company was allowed to change its technology and price bid. CAG also says a competing bid from the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) was also non-compliant. Interestingly, after the deal was all but done, in June 2012, the then defence minister asked for an overview of the entire process. By the time this overview was complete, the government had changed. This overview, results of which were submitted in March 2015, found bids of both Dassault and EADS non-compliant and recommended that the process be restarted.

And so, 15 years after the process began, India found itself at the starting point again. A reading of the CAG report shows that this isn?t unique to the fighter deal. It mentions a 2012 acquisition of 11 Doppler Radars by the Air Force, which took 96 months, and points out that the India Meteorological Department, also a government department, took a mere 11 months to acquire the same equipment. Irrespective of what their positions may be on the Rafale deal, the government and the opposition need to agree that the defence acquisition process needs an overhaul. The new government (whichever one) that takes over in May would do well to set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee to do this.",CAG report on Rafale highlights the flawed process,The Hindustan Times,
49,Rafale Deal,"When an institution that believes in hi-tech surveillance of ordinary citizens fails to prevent some of its most precious documents from being stolen, it is the stuff of pure comedy. Only when that institution is the government of a country, it is no longer comic but dangerous. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre has declared that crucial documents relating to the Rafale deal have been stolen. The dangers this implies are multiple. The disconnect is dizzying: while the ministry of home affairs empowers Central agencies to snoop on citizens? computers to stop crime and terrorism, the defence ministry is blind to the thieves in its midst. While the BJP?s minions seize ?anti-nationals? and mobs kill people from minority groups in the name of cow protection while beating up Kashmiris on the side, a targeted little burglary is executed in the building that houses the defence and foreign ministries and the Prime Minister?s Office. This argues incompetence of such gigantic proportions that comedy vanishes. It must have been this incompetence that allowed a private vehicle loaded with explosives to destroy a truck full of jawans amid a military convoy on a highly protected route. It is the same incompetence, this time in propaganda, that has ministers and officials scrambling to reach an agreement on the number of dead militants in Balakot.

There is, shamefully enough, another side to the government?s declaration. The allegedly stolen papers were used by a newspaper to expose dubious aspects of the Rafale deal. The government appears unable to conceal its anxiety that these documents might be used as evidence in court. Perhaps it hopes that if they have been stolen ? a charge not made when the newspaper used them ? their ?unclean? source may discredit them as evidence. To distract attention from a mess that is obviously far from simple, the government, through its mouthpiece in court, is talking of the newspaper?s supposed violation of the Official Secrets Act. Wielding laws is the easy way out. More dangerous, however, is the Narendra Modi-led government?s attitude towards journalism. Independent thinking, analysis, criticism and pursuit of truth for public interest are simply impermissible. But it may become a bit awkward if the media now begin concentrating on finding out how the Rafale papers were stolen.",Missing Rafale papers would be pure comedy if it weren't dangerous,The Telegraph,
50,Rafale Deal,"Preparations for the Ram mandir bhoomi poojan in Ayodhya, scheduled for August 5, are on in full swing, with the city being painted in yellow ? the colour of knowledge and auspiciousness.

The prayers and the ceremony are to start Tuesday morning with the worship of Lord Hanuman?s mark in Ayodhya, as he is believed to preside over the city. The programme was scheduled for Sunday but was postponed due to the weekend lockdowns in Uttar Pradesh amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Continuous Akhand Ramayan recitation in all local temples and a Deepotsava by lighting oil lamps in houses, temples and the Saryu River on the night of August 4 and 5 have been announced.


An invitation to the programme, written in red and black over a yellow background, has already been mailed to the guests, asking them to be present at Karsevakpuram in Ayodhya by Tuesday 4 pm for the historical bhoomi poojan. The event on Wednesday is to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Sources close to the Shri Ram Janambhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, which is the organiser of the event, said that the list of more than 260 invitees has been trimmed to 175, to ensure social distancing.

The list includes 133 saints and seers from 36 spiritual traditions all over the country, along with BJP leaders, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) office bearers and dignitaries connected to the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), among others.

A few confirmed names, apart from PM Modi, are UP Governor Anandi Ben Patel, CM Yogi Adityanath, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and Trust president Mahant Nritya Gopal Das.

On Wednesday, PM Modi is expected to start the event by offering prayers at the famous Hanuman Garhi temple, where he is scheduled to spend no more than seven minutes. He is then expected to visit the makeshift Ram Lalla temple made of wood and glass, where he will be given chandan and prasad after he offers flowers to the deity.


The bhoomi poojan will include chanting of mantras, and after shovelling the earth, worship of the ground and the shila. As per officials in Ayodhya, a 22.60 kg brick made of pure silver will be used for the bhoomi poojan ceremony.

Keeping in mind Covid norms, arrangements are such that all those attending will sit at a distance of six feet from each other. Only five people, including PM Modi, Anandi Ben Patel, Adityanath, Bhagwat and Mahant Das are expected to sit on the main stage.

Following the Wednesday programme, the construction of the temple will begin in full swing. Members of the trust claim the construction will take between six months and a year.",,,
