1,Article 370,"Jammu and Kashmir has been a theatre of muscular Hindutva nationalism, in the early decades in script and since 2014 in performance. Adopting a highly militarist approach to separatism, and shunning political process entirely since 2014, the BJP has now delivered on a promise it has long made, by abrogating the special status that Jammu and Kashmir had enjoyed in the Constitution through a combination of executive and parliamentary measures. Additionally, the State is being downgraded and divided into two Union Territories. The mechanism that the government used to railroad its rigid ideological position on Jammu and Kashmir through the Rajya Sabha was both hasty and stealthy. This move will strain India?s social fabric not only in its impact on Jammu and Kashmir but also in the portents it holds for federalism, parliamentary democracy and diversity. The BJP-led government has undermined parliamentary authority in multiple ways since 2014, but the passing of legislation as far-reaching as dismembering a State without prior consultations has set a new low. The founding fathers of the Republic favoured a strong Centre, but they were also prudent in seeking the route of persuasion and accommodation towards linguistic and religious minorities in the interest of national integration. The centralising tendencies increased in the following decades, but Hindu nationalists always argued for stronger unitary provisions and viewed all particular aspirations with suspicion. For them, Jammu and Kashmir?s special constitutional status was an impediment, not an instrument, for the region?s integration with the rest of the country.
 
The entire exercise of getting Article 370 of the Constitution effectively abrogated has been marked by executive excess. The first step was to declare by a presidential decree that the ?Governor? ? without regard to the fact that he has no Council of Ministers now to aid and advise him ? can speak for the State government and give his concurrence to any modification in the way the Constitution of India applies to Jammu and Kashmir. Second, on the basis of this ?concurrence?, the latest Presidential Order scraps the previous one of 1954, abrogating the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. Third, the fact that the State is under President?s Rule has been used to usher in a new dispensation under which Jammu and Kashmir becomes a Union Territory with a legislature and Ladakh another such territory without a legislature. In sum, a purported process to change the constitutional status of a sensitive border State has been achieved without any legislative input or representative contribution from its people. The bifurcation of States in the past cannot be cited as a binding precedent as, under Article 3 of the Constitution, the President seeks the views of the legislature of the States concerned, even if concurrence is not mandatory. In the present scenario, J&K has been represented by an unelected Governor appointed by the Centre, while Parliament has ventured to ratify the conversion of a State into two Union Territories without any recommendation from the State.

If there is a legal challenge to these measures, it would centre around whether such far-reaching steps could be achieved in the absence of a representative government by assuming that its gubernatorial administrator is constitutionally capable of using his consent as that of the entire State. Further, there is a self-enabling aspect to the Presidential Order. It performs a hop-step-and-jump feat. It hops over the requirement of the State government?s consent by declaring that the Governor is the State government. It steps over the need for aid and advice by the ministerial council by saying the Governor?s opinion is enough. And it jumps over the fact that there is no constituent assembly now by merely reading the term as ?legislative assembly?, and letting Parliament perform the role of the State legislature. Thus the President?s power under Article 370 has been used both to create an enabling provision and to exercise it immediately to modify the Order, thereby dispensing with the role envisaged for the State Assembly. While it is true that in 1961 the Supreme Court upheld the President?s power to ?modify? the constitutional provisions in applying them to J&K, it is a moot question whether this can be invoked to make such a radical change: a functioning State has now been downgraded and bifurcated into two Union Territories. It is inconceivable that any State legislature would ever have recommended its own demotion in status.


True, the special status of J&K was meant to end, but only with the concurrence of its people. The Centre?s abrupt move disenfranchised them on a matter that directly affected their life and sentiments. Moreover, that this was done after a massive military build-up and the house arrest of senior political leaders, and the communications shutdown reveals a cynical disregard of democratic norms. It appears that the current government values J&K for its demonstrative impact before the rest of the country, as a place where a strong nation and its strong leader show uncompromising political will. But that may have other unintended consequences. Geographically and metaphorically, Jammu and Kashmir is the crown of secular India ? a Muslim majority region in a Hindu majority country. Its people and leaders had chosen secular India over Islamic Pakistan, a fact that Islamists never reconciled with. The BJP?s adventurous route also has as backdrop an impending U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that will trigger an unforeseeable churn in Islamist politics in the region. Islamists have always viewed Kashmir as a component of their global grievances. Whatever its intent in enabling the full integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India, Monday?s decision to alter the State?s status could have unintended and dangerous consequences.",Scrapping J&K's special status is the wrong way to an end,The Hindu,UPA
2,Article 370,"In a momentous decision, government moved Parliament yesterday to abate Article 370 of the Constitution and supersede Article 35A, thereby effectively ceasing the special status for Jammu & Kashmir. Simultaneously, Union home minister Amit Shah introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill to bifurcate the state and create two separate Union territories ? Jammu & Kashmir with a legislature, and Ladakh without a legislature. This means that the Constitution of India shall now apply in full force across J&K and Ladakh, and the J&K legislature will henceforth not have any discretionary powers to decide who permanent residents of the territory are or provide them with special rights with respect to employment and acquisition of property.
Abrogating Article 370 has been a long-held wish of BJP which sees the provision as a historical wrong. However, the complicated history of Kashmir and the sensitivity surrounding the matter had hitherto prevented such a move. But with the current BJP government projecting muscular nationalism and enjoying significant numerical strength in Parliament, cessation of Article 370 became more doable. Given that abrogating Article 370 was part of the BJP manifesto, on the basis of which it swept Lok Sabha polls, the government has the mandate to do this. That non-NDA parties like BSP, AAP, YSRCP, BJD and AIADMK too have come out in support of the government?s move shows which way the winds are blowing.
Arguably, Article 370 had contributed to the problems in Kashmir. The state?s special powers of autonomy meant in practice arrogation of power by a tiny Valley elite, which led to a feeling of not being represented among the people of Jammu and Ladakh, as well as disaffection feeding into separatist sentiment in the Valley itself. And given that Kashmir came to be a troubled state with separatist sentiments being stoked by Pakistan with the help of cross-border terrorism, this may have been the worst of both worlds. Besides, Article 370 was meant to be a temporary provision. In that sense its cessation now is congruent with historical constitutional perspective.
That said, there are some issues with the way in which Article 370 is being nullified and the state bifurcated. Even according to the constitutional provision to abate Article 370, consultation with the J&K state assembly is deemed necessary before a constitutional order to this effect is passed. The government, however, has chosen to use the fact that there is no J&K government at the moment and substituted the latter with the J&K governor. While this approach may or may not be legally valid, it certainly bypasses wider discussion on the matter that would have been democratically sound.
Second, the logic behind converting the state into two Union territories is also not plain. True, there has been a demand for Union territory status in Ladakh for some time. But with the cessation of Article 370, the special powers accruing to the J&K assembly in Srinagar would also extinguish. Thus, it is debatable if bifurcation of the state and creation of the Union territory of Ladakh was necessary after that.
In fact, this would be the first time in the history of India that a state was being converted into Union territories ? the trend has been the other way around. Hence, given the magnitude of the decision, more all-round discussion would have been prudent. But perhaps government?s decision to push ahead with its Article 370 move was linked to external factors. With the US looking to wind down its military engagement in Afghanistan and turning to Pakistan to facilitate a peace deal with Afghan Taliban, Islamabad has been upping the ante on Kashmir.
New Delhi perhaps felt that Islamabad was gaining too much leverage in the emerging regional scenario and had to do something to counter this. Whatever the compulsions, even if Article 370 is abrogated New Delhi will have to ? sooner rather than later ? grant full statehood rights to Jammu & Kashmir and perhaps Ladakh too, for the sake of democratic governance as well as the federal principles in which India is grounded.","Changing the game in Kashmir: In nullifying Article 370 and bifurcating state, government has redrawn strategic calculus",The times of India,Neutral
3,Article 370,"India?s shock decision this week to revoke the autonomy of its restive state of Jammu and Kashmir is a crucial test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Without a change of course, he?s likely to fail.

Kashmir is arguably the worst legacy of the fratricidal partition of British India in 1947. One of more than 500 princely states in the subcontinent at the time, its Hindu ruler cast his lot with India after tribal fighters from Pakistan attempted his overthrow. The two nations have since fought three wars over the overwhelmingly Muslim territory. India controls the bulk of the state; Pakistan administers about a third and China claims a portion of its Himalayan plateau.


How India treats its portion of Kashmir matters for two reasons. One is that the state is the primary flashpoint for the world?s most dangerous nuclear rivalry; terrorist attacks there have repeatedly brought India and Pakistan to the brink of hostilities. It?s also the lone Muslim-majority state within Hindu-majority India, and thus an essential test of the country?s diversity and tolerance.

Given these sensitivities, Modi?s government might?ve approached the matter with discretion. Quite the opposite. With no warning, it revoked Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which granted Kashmir a degree of autonomy, while breaking up the state into two ?union territories? largely controlled from New Delhi. Authorities placed hundreds of local leaders under house arrest, dispatched thousands of troops to the already heavily militarized state, evacuated tourists, imposed a curfew, and cut off communications links. The parliamentary maneuvers the government used to ram through its decision were so dubious they?ve already landed before the Supreme Court.


All this hardly needed doing: Most of the special privileges afforded to the state on paper had long been whittled away in practice. Nor is anyone challenging the unique rights enjoyed by some other states in India. The clear implication is that Modi?s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was intent on eliminating rather than celebrating a Muslim-majority state.


Changing Kashmir?s status won?t do anything to ease tensions with Pakistan. To the contrary, it will further empower the Pakistani military, long the main roadblock to peace on the subcontinent. India desperately needs a real strategy to engage with Pakistan, commercially as well as diplomatically. Instead Modi?s government seems convinced it can continue to ignore, isolate and deter its rival. One result is that trade between the two countries has now broken down entirely.

Perhaps most galling, though, is that Modi neglected to bring on board those Indians with the greatest stake in his decision: Kashmiris. BJP officials insist that closer integration will improve the lives of Kashmiris by opening the floodgates to jobs and investment, but this is questionable. (Private investment in India hit a 14-year low earlier this year, while unemployment stands at a 45-year high.) In any case, a sudden influx of outside businesses would fuel paranoia and resentment among locals, as it has wherever else such policies have been tried.

The issue India ultimately needs to address in Kashmir isn?t a lack of jobs, or even Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. It?s the lack of agency felt by too many Kashmiris, exacerbated by a suffocating security presence they view as an occupation. Forcibly imposing the central government?s will over the state will only intensify those grievances.

Democracies as large and heterogeneous as India cannot escape internal tensions. But the way to relieve such pressure is to decentralize power and give citizens a greater stake in their governance, as well as more control over local resources.

Modi?s government is heading in the opposite direction in Kashmir. Until India finds some way to make Kashmiris feel like full citizens, in control of their lives and their destinies, their land will remain what it has been for far too long: a troubled place, and a threat to peace and prosperity.",India Is Making a Mistake in Kashmir,Bloomberg,UPA
4,Article 370,"The reading down of Article 370, which granted limited autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmir hereafter), by the Indian parliament on August 5, 2019, has evoked strong reactions from the supporters and the opponents of this move.  

Those in favour of repealing Article 370 have often argued that its revocation is consistent with the principles of Indian federalism (albeit in more crude terms).

They contend that while state governments may exist and deal specifically with local issues, ultimately, the federal government should reign supreme.

Following this line of reasoning, Kashmir?s special status under the constitution is an affront to the founding principles of India. To constrain the Union government?s powers to make legislation affecting Kashmiris is to elevate Kashmir?s status above all other Indian states. And that is something India?s ruling party and its supporters simply cannot abide.  

These notions certainly seem to be forthcoming in Indian Home Minister Amit Shah?s position on the special status of Kashmir. In a speech made to Parliament, he asserted ?This treaty (Instrument of Accession) was not only made with Jammu-Kashmir, it was made with the 630 princely states of the nation. The treaty was made with 630 princely states, and 370 was not there.?

The claim that Kashmir?s instrument of accession (IOA) was functionally no different to those signed by other princely states is incredibly disingenuous.

By signing the IOA, the princely states ceded power to the dominion of India regarding defence, external affairs and communications. If the process of integration had stopped there, India would have remained a loose federation of autonomous states.

The India we know today was formed through a series of merger agreements signed by the heads of princely states, which incorporated their polities into the Union of India. These merger agreements were often signed under duress with limited reference to the interests of the people they were affecting. Regardless, however, they can be perceived to have been accepted and entrenched by the acquiescence of subsequent generations residing in the state. 

A faulty argument

Kashmir is different from other princely states because it never signed a merger agreement fully accepting the constitution of India. Instead, it explicitly negotiated autonomy which was entrenched in the Indian constitution through Article 370.

The provision allowed Kashmir to have a parallel constitution, ensuring that the provisions of Indian constitution were effective in Kashmir only with the concurrence of the Kashmir assembly ?  representative body of the state.

In light of this, to claim Kashmir?s treaty was the same as that signed by 630 other states is to reduce the complex process of integration to one document. Integration was a multi-stage process that required negotiation with various princely states and unions. It cannot be condensed into a single procedure, as the BJP would have the world believe. 

One justification for the reading down of Article 370 offered by the ruling BJP and its supporters is that it would accelerate the economic development of the state. Dubious as this argument is, even if one were to take it seriously, it would call for convincing the people of Kashmir, or their elected representatives, to vote for a complete integration with India.

There is a precedent for it. The state of Sikkim signed a treaty with India in 1950, which limited the role of India to defence, external affairs and communication, similar to the IOA signed with princely states. It was only in 1975 that Sikkim was fully integrated with India after its assembly passed a resolution to this effect and was ratified by a statewide referendum. That is the democratic way!

Ultimately, however, Modi?s government seems unconcerned with historical realities in its path to reading down Kashmir?s constitutional protections. In light of this, pointing to the inaccuracies in the way Kashmir?s IOA and Article 370 are construed are unlikely to alter the position of BJP supporters and their ilk. 

What hope then is left for those in favour of upholding Kashmir?s constitutional status?

One option would be to seek a remedy under international law. This would involve making appeals to an international community that is often reticent to intervene in state matters, particularly when questions of ?territorial integrity? and sovereignty are raised.

Additionally, even if the international law could provide a resolution, its primary body, the International Court of Justice relies on the consent of the involved parties to hear matters. That nationalistic vigour with which the BJP has promoted its position on Kashmir makes it seem incredibly unlikely that it would now surrender itself to international law.  

The Supreme Court

Perhaps a more realistic prospect is a favourable ruling from the Supreme Court of India. The question of whether Article 370 is indefinitely entrenched in the Indian constitution has been a vexing one for Indian courts. The article provides that it may only be repealed in conjunction with the assent of Kashmir?s constituent assembly. That body was dissolved in 1957 and made no recommendations regarding an amendment to Article 370.


This poses a challenging issue for Indian courts as to whether the requirement for assent from the constituent assembly is a dead letter. Lower courts in India have posited that the requirement continues to operate, with Kashmir?s state government now taking the place of the constituent assembly. Some, perhaps more ambitiously, have posited that following the dissolution of the constituent assembly, Article 370 has an eternal effect.

In any case, treating the assent of the governor of the state, a representative of the centre, as tantamount to the assent of Kashmiris or their representatives, which is what the current process of abrogation of article 370 has done, would make a mockery of the notion of federalism. 

If the Supreme Court rejects these views and upholds the unilateral reading down of Article 370, an intriguing paradox comes into play for the BJP. Kashmir?s IOA, which had been entrenched in Article 370(b)(i), would be successfully dislodged from the Indian constitution.

This would relegate the IOA?s legitimacy in the domestic sphere and significantly alter the constitutional protections on Kashmiri autonomy.

Problematically though, the IOA is the very nexus of India?s claims over Kashmir, which it often reverts to in disputes with Pakistan. It is the legal validation of Kashmir?s status as de jure Indian territory.

Declaring the instrument meaningless would betray the inconsistencies of India?s position over Kashmir. It would involve undermining the very document which India relies on as a source of its authority before the international community. 

The aforementioned situation creates a paradox, which calls for immediate explanation. It seems that Modi is faced with a perplexing choice. He may either relentlessly dismiss the rights of Kashmiris or maintain India?s legitimacy in the global sphere. ",Article 370 and The Paradox of Kashmir?s Accession,The Wire,UPA
5,Article 370,"The NDA government?s decision to abrogate the special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 fulfills a nearly 70-year-old project of Hindutva parties, their promise that they would one day make the ?integration? of J&K with the Union of India a reality. The Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order 2019 supersedes the 1954 order, which included Article 35 A, and defined the state?s special status. Article 35 A has ceased to exist. Although Article 370 remains, it?s effectively dead. The government has simultaneously proposed the bifurcation of the state through the Jammu & Kashmir State Reorganisation Bill 2019, under which it will become two Union Territories, one comprising Ladakh without a legislature, another comprising Jammu & Kashmir, with a legislature.

But the special status guaranteed to Jammu and Kashmir was not a partisan or personal decision of the founding fathers of the Indian republic. It was based in the imperative of nation-building. It was a recognition of the role a Muslim majority state ? its unique demography protected by the Constitution ? would play in belying the claims on which Partition had taken place, and in strengthening the secular ?idea of India?. The developments of August 5, 2019, are in no small measure about rewriting history, changing that very demography, and bringing in a new idea of India, with the stamp of Narendra Modi firmly on it. The changes are no less than historic, they draw an audacious red line over and across the Nehruvian idea of India.

But what is this new idea of India, and how will it be given shape? What will also go down in history is the manner in which the momentous change in J&K?s status has been brought about. There is no parallel in the history of independent India for the secrecy and stealth deployed by the government to bring in something that is politically and communally contentious. To do this at a time when Parliament is in session, to present it as a virtual fait accompli to the House, may be the BJP?s way of doing business, as it believes it has the mandate. But it goes against every democratic convention and norm.

Curiously, government officials put out the red herring of a purported terror plot emanating from Pakistan to justify the induction of additional troops in the Valley and cancellation of the Amarnath Yatra. As it has turned out, these were law and order measures in anticipation of a backlash to the government?s real plans. For the first time since the 1953 arrest of Sheikh Abdullah, the government placed two former chief ministers, both leaders of mainstream political parties, under arrest.

The promise of resolving the Kashmir issue through partnership and dialogue with Kashmiris, articulated by a BJP prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and carried forward by a Congress prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was implicit in the PDP-BJP alliance of 2015-2018. It failed, yet as recently as last year, Prime Minister Modi invoked Vajpayee?s ?insaaniyat, jahmuriyat, Kashmiriyat? credo for resolution in Kashmir. It now seems that he and his trusted lieutenant believe that the people of Kashmir need not be consulted at all about their political fate, and that the use of force can overcome their opposition.

Now that the die has been cast, how the government proposes to carry this forward from here, how it will deal with the legal and political fallout and the reactions in the Valley, will decide many things for India. If the unkept promise of autonomy in Article 370 was the genesis of the Kashmir problem, the government has significantly departed from that, not just by its definitive move to scrap the constitutional guarantee of that autonomy but by demoting the state into truncated union territories that will now be governed directly by the Union home ministry through an all powerful Lt. Governor, working with an emasculated legislature.

Regional parties, such as AIADMK and TRS, that have supported the government?s move, might do well to ask themselves what they would do if the Centre decided that Tamil Nadu, with a traditionally strong regional ethos, be carved up into union territories. But the challenge for the Opposition is also more than a distant thought experiment. It is real and it is already here: A BJP that is bringing its ?core issues? ? for long relegated to the backburner ? to centrestage. A BJP with a mandate that will have its way, few questions asked.

It cannot be the government?s intention to keep voices in the Valley suppressed forever. For starters, it must release Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Sajjad Lone, leaders with a following in the Valley and in Jammu too. It must remove restrictions on movement in the Valley, allow telecommunications to be restarted. It must demonstrate that its political confidence to do what it has done in Kashmir does not flow out of the barrel of a gun or a numerical majority alone. There will be other challenges, such as the changing dynamics in the region, especially the deal with Pakistan?s help, in Afghanistan between the US and Taliban. This is hard work in progress even though the deed has been done.","Rupture in history, stitching a future",The Indian Express,NDA
6,Article 370,"The narrative around Article 370 has largely been premised on the argument that it was meant to be a ?temporary provision?. This argument draws its basis from the Marginal Note to Article 370, which contain the words ?temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir?. However, we must remember the place of Marginal Notes in interpreting a statute.  

English courts were cautious in using Marginal Notes. On different occasions, they have referred to them as a ?most unsure guide to construction? and a ?poor guide to the scope of a section?, further stating that ?rarely it might throw some light to the intentions of the Parliament? etc.

The Indian Supreme Court too, [for a long time], followed the same approach and refrained from employing Marginal Notes to interpret a statute. The Supreme Court, while interpreting an Article of the Constitution, referred to the Marginal Note, only to get a prima facie clue to the purpose of the Article, and in case of a conflict between the Marginal Note and the main provision, the Marginal Note gives way to the main provision. The approach of the Government to except, modify or amend Article 370 seems to be influenced by the Marginal Note to the Article.  

Article 370(3) gives the power to the President of India to declare that the Article has ceased to be operative and is a dead letter of the Constitution. Noticeably, Article 370(3) has a strong ?proviso?. One of the functions of a ?proviso? in an enactment, as stated by the Supreme Court, is to ?entirely change the very concept of the intendment of the enactment by insisting on certain mandatory conditions to be fulfilled in order to make the enactment workable?.

The proviso to Article 370(3), which states that the President ?shall? obtain recommendation of the Constituent Assembly before making such declaration, clearly imposes the mandatory condition on the President of obtaining the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir before the power to cause Article 370 to be inoperative is exercised. . The Constituent Assembly of J&K, which was constituted by a proclamation of the Maharaja of Jammu & Kashmir in 1951, was dissolved in 1957 and  presently there is no Constituent Assembly.  

After the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, Article 370 ceased to be a ?temporary provision? not amenable to modification and exception through a Presidential Order. This contention is best understood, if one reads the article without reading the Marginal note, for the body of the provision does not at all use the word ?temporary?.

The Constitution Order, 2019 (C.O.272)
The BJP obviously has been reading the Marginal Note of Article 370 with greater emphasis and the main provision with greater disdain and lesser care. The recent developments are an actualization of the longstanding agenda of the BJP, reflected consistently in its election manifestos ? including the 2019 one ? which stated ??We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Article 370. We are committed to annulling Article 35A of the Constitution of India as the provision is discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir??.

In order to annul Article 35A, a suitable order had to be passed under Article 370(1) and to abrogate Article 370, the President needed to make a declaration under Article 370(3), which he could not achieve without the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly, which no longer exists. The Supreme Court has, on several occasions, returned a finding that Article 370 has become a permanent provision for this very same reason, i.e. it cannot be abrogated anymore as the Constituent Assembly, whose recommendation is a requirement for abrogation, has ceased to exist.

The government of the day has achieved its objective through means that would elicit disapproval from constitutional purists. By the Constitutional Order 272, the Government has superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954 ? under which Article 35A was inserted ? and additionally, has given a fatal blow to Article 370, by replacing the expression ""Constituent Assembly? with ?legislative assembly? in order to bring about its abrogation,.  

Assault on Federalism
The position of Jammu and Kashmir is unique ? both within the Union of India and also in the Indian Constitution. Jammu and Kashmir was a princely state that acceded to the Union under special circumstances.

Gopalaswami Iyengar, while moving the draft provision (Article 306A, which was renumbered as Article 370) before the constituent assembly, spelt out those special circumstances. While elucidating the case for special treatment under the constitution, he emphasized that the Government of India had committed that the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir ? expressed through its constituent assembly ? would determine the sphere of jurisdiction of the Union over the state.

In the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly, Sheikh Abdullah cautioned ?that any suggestion of altering arbitrarily the basis of our relationship with India would constitute a breach of the spirit and the letter of the Constitution??.

Article 370, therefore, stands like a constitutional guarantee setting out the terms under which the princely state came to join the Union. Jammu and Kashmir, as a federating unit of the Union of India, joined the Union under the promise recognised by the constituent assembly of India and crystalized by the Constitution of India under Article 370. Altering those promises and modifying the special relationship in the manner that has been done under the constitutional orders is an assault on this particular federal relationship. The Supreme Court of India has recognized federalism as the basic structure of the constitution and the abrogation of Article 370 is destructive of federalism and therefore an assault on the basic structure of the Indian constitution.

Another agenda of the BJP is to ensure the construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhaya and its members often refer to the creation of Ram Rajya in India. The BJP may like to be reminded that one of the inviolable principles of Ram Rajya is ?Raghu kul reet sada chali aaee, prana jayee par vachan na jaaee? (It is the tradition of Raghu?s dynasty, to which Lord Ram belonged, that a promise given is to be honoured, even at the cost of life).  

The abrogation of Article 370 is letting go of the promise that the framers of the constitution had made to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

7,Article 370,"The contentious Article 370 is part of the history now. In a predictable move after days of troop buildup in the Kashmir valley, the Modi Government on Monday scrapped Article 370 to do away with Jammu & Kashmir?s special status and also proposed the bifurcation of the State into two union territories, Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh.

By doing so, the BJP-led dispensation hopes to fulfill its poll promise and deal with a protracted militancy movement that has been ravaging the State for past three decades.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced the decision in the Rajya Sabha, which approved the resolution and the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill. Both will now come up in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

The Government?s effort to tackle head-on the vexatious 72-year-old problem wracking the soul of the nation sent a wave of jubilation among BJP supporters and others, but provoked outrage from the National Conference and the PDP, the principal political parties in Jammu & Kashmir.

According to the resolution moved by the Home Minister, Article 370 ceases to be operative from Monday itself. ?The President on the recommendation of Parliament is pleased to declare as from 5th of August 2019, all clauses of the said Article 370 shall cease to be operative...,? the resolution stated.

Shah also moved a Bill proposing bifurcation of J&K into two union territories ? Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. The union territory in Ladakh will have no legislature like Chandigarh. The other union territory of Jammu & Kashmir will have a legislature like Delhi and Puducherry, where key subjects like law and order are with the Centre.

Shah said full statehood will be restored to Jammu & Kashmir at ?appropriate time? and after ?normalcy? returns. The Government will not allow the situation to turn into another battle torn Kosovo, he said.

The Government hopes that abrogation of Article 370 that accorded special status to Jammu & Kashmir and the consequential end of Article 35A that defines the permanent residents of the State will help in the integration of the erstwhile J&K State into the Union of India like any other state or union territories and cease special rights enjoyed by its citizens on land, business and employment.

As the Government moved a Bill to convert J&K into a union territory with an Assembly and a Lieutenant Governor and thereby the Centre wielding major power over it, the State has ?lost? its privileged status like Assembly enjoying six-year tenure, outsiders not allowed to buy land and Kashmiri women marrying outside forfeiting their rights over land in Kashmir. 

Twenty four seats which fall in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) shall remain vacant in new Assembly of J&K union territory.

Abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35-A would permit citizens outside Kashmir to move in, settle and start business in the new union territory of J&K, barring special restrictions imposed by its Government. The Union Government would now play a central role in controlling State police and land issues.

Lt Governor who will ?consult the Election Commission? will have final powers over deciding the disqualification of Assembly members in J&K. Its Assembly will not legislate on ?public order? and ?police?. Law of Parliament ?shall prevail? if a law made in State list in the seventh schedule to the Constitution ?is repugnant to any provision of law made by Parliament?.

Similarly, ?a Bill or amendment shall not be introduced in Legislative Assembly except on recommendation of the Lt Governor? on imposition, abolition, remission, alternation of any tax or relation to consolidated fund of India, seats for SC/STs would be reserved in J&K Assembly.

According to the Government, the abolition of Article 370 will ?completely integrate? the State with the Indian Union like other princely States in 1950 and its residents will enjoy equal rights like other citizens.

The large population of young Kashmiris, studying and working in other States of India will get the ?power and confidence? to be equal citizens of India, without they being categorised as a special citizen.

According to Government officials, the ease with which private and public investment will flow into both these new UTs will lead to much faster development of the economy, the development of high-quality educational institutions and the flow of a large corpus of funds to develop tourism in these underdeveloped regions, they said.

The Presidential order signed by the President of India has not scrapped Article 370. But invoking this very Article, special status of J&K has been withdrawn. Thus Article 370 is very much on the statute book, say constitutional and legal experts.

Some insignificant amendments have been made by this order such as substitution of term Constituent Assembly by the State by the Legislative Assembly of State and Sadar-e-Riyasat by the Governor of State.

Presidential Order has extended all the provisions of constitution to Kashmir.","J&K no more ?special?, Art 370 goes",The Pioneer,NDA
8,Article 370,"It?s been two months since the government decided to push through constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in Parliament. Article 370 was effectively abrogated; the state was bifurcated; and J&K and Ladakh, it was decided, would now become Union Territories (UTs). The constitutional changes ? and there is no doubt that the government had adequate mandate and legislative support for it ? were accompanied by a clampdown in the Valley. Communication links were snapped. Security mobilisation was ramped up. Political leaders, including those who had sworn by the Indian Constitution, were detained.


The government?s case was simple. It argued that restrictions were necessary to prevent violence, for ease of communication and mobility would give terrorists an advantage. This, to be fair, has proved effective, for compared to earlier protests, killings have been at a minimal. But this has come at a cost. Civil liberties and fundamental rights of citizens ? and Kashmiris are entitled to the same rights as all other Indians ? were compromised. Normal life was affected. And political mobilisation ? once again a key democratic right ? was curtailed.

It is time for a review. The government must now lift restrictions, without compromising security. It must release Kashmir?s mainstream leaders, of the National Conference, the Peoples Democratic Party, as well as other smaller forces which have participated in elections under the Indian constitutional framework. These leaders have spoken up for India in difficult of times. Terrorists have killed thousands of mainstream activists because of their pro-India stance. The continued detention of these leaders only strengthens the Valley?s radicals. Their release will benefit Delhi in two ways. For one, its ambition of bringing development to J&K cannot be fulfilled without local partners; elections in the UT would not have legitimacy without the participation of locally established forces; and democratic activity needs to find an outlet. And second, releasing leaders will allay apprehensions in the international community. The fact that the leading contender for the Democratic nomination in the US presidential race, Elizabeth Warren, has now expressed concern must caution Delhi that international attention is not fading. but growing. For India to fulfil domestic objectives, and win international support, Kashmir needs to open up.",Free Kashmir?s democrats ,The Hindustan Times,Neutral
9,Article 370,"A balm is usually administered after a bitter pill. The prime minister?s recent address to the nation, three days after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government decided to do away with Jammu and Kashmir?s special status and statehood, is perhaps a case in point. In his speech ? a barely disguised attempt to mollify an aggrieved constituency ? Narendra Modi made a number of promises. The prime minister assured his audience, among other things, a gradual relaxation of prohibitory orders, an election that would, Mr Modi is certain, lead to a ?government by the people and of the people?, as well as the speedy implementation of development. All of these pledges sound reassuring. But there is a case to argue that the people in Kashmir as well as those concerned with the goings-on in that restive state would have been far more satisfied if Mr Modi ? a stickler for deadlines ? had spelt out a concrete time frame to implement his pledges. The absence of a timetable for the restoration of statehood is certain to inflict yet another blow to the morale of a people who have expressed their resentment, time and again, against what they claim are unilateral interventions from the Centre.

There is no doubt about the fact that the BJP?s move to do away with most of the provisions of Article 370 enjoys considerable public support. The rhetoric of triumphant nationalism advocated by the prime minister and his party has even forced segments in the Opposition to toe the BJP?s line on Kashmir. But Kashmir remains sceptical of the BJP?s promises and design. Mr Modi may be aware of this simmering discontent. That could explain why the prime minister in his speech chose not to refer to some telling anomalies. If, as Mr Modi claims, Article 370 had bred only ?separatism?, why is it that its abrogation has been met with such hostility in Kashmir itself? The anger in Kashmir ? communication links with the state remain tenuous for days now ? cannot be a testimony to the oneness that the BJP claims to have achieved. The trouble with Mr Modi?s party lies in its conflation of unity with unilateralism. This aggression is against the formative idea of India itself, a vision that championed the cause of accommodation and federalism. The key to the Kashmir problem lies in resurrecting the flickering spirit of democratic assimilation.",Kashmir: Swallowing a bitter pill,The Telegraph,NDA
10,Farm Bill,"Parliament must not abridge right of MPs to take a stand in debates and votes
Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh?s refusal to conduct a division of votes on two controversial pieces of legislation on Sunday, despite persistent demands from members, was unprecedented in its sheer brazenness. The Bills in question have been challenged on constitutional and practical grounds, but that is a different point. The rules of procedure regarding voting are unambiguous that if a voice vote is challenged, ?votes shall be taken by operating the automatic vote recorder or by the members going into the Lobbies?. Even if a single member demands a division, it is required to be carried out. Quite often, a division of vote is demanded even when the outcome is predictable, in order to bring on record the positions of parties and members on a particular bill. The explanation that members were not demanding a division from their seats and the House was not in order is disingenuous. To begin with, the disorder was triggered by the Chair?s refusal to order a division. And curiously, the Chair went on to declare the Bills passed amid the din, this time unaffected by disorder. Significant amendments were sought and several parties had demanded that they be referred to a parliamentary select committee. The government?s claim that it had the numbers to pass the Bills is dubious in the wake of the skulduggery it deployed for their passage. In any case, regardless of which side has the majority, procedure is sacrosanct and voting is the foremost tool of establishing parliamentary authority. It cannot be reduced to an act of benevolence by the Chair or the executive.

The chaos that followed in the Upper House, though not unprecedented, was unsavoury. Parliament is a deliberative forum and not a theatre for protest demonstration. Regardless of the provocation, the Opposition should have adhered to decorum while articulating its concerns. But, meaningful parliamentary discussions have become infrequent, and the voice of the Opposition is often ignored. Upper House functions have been significantly curtailed by the arbitrary labelling of money bills, which bypass it. The flat out denial of a division of votes was a new low in parliamentary history. Not stopping there, eight Opposition members were suspended for one week while notice for a no-confidence motion against the Deputy Chairman was rejected at the threshold by Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu. Opposition parties have now petitioned President Ram Nath Kovind to not give assent to the two Bills passed by voice vote. There must be immediate efforts led by the executive to restore the effective and meaningful functioning of Parliament.",A point of order: On farm bills,The Hindu,
11,Farm Bill,"The passage of two key farm reform bills by Parliament with the potential to boost farm incomes and productivity should have been a historic occasion. When Parliament is called upon to perform its job of discussing, scrutinising and enacting pathbreaking legislations, the government of the day must go out of the way to ensure orderly functioning and build a consensus, if possible. Unfortunately, the Farmers? Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, did not get the solidarity they deserved.

While envisaging a big leap in agricultural trade, the legislations chip away at regulatory privileges enjoyed by state governments. This has stoked farmer unrest in some states and many non-BJP ruled states, and opposition MPs, commanding respectable numbers in Rajya Sabha, came prepared for a confrontation. Two key demands ? examination of bills by a select committee and deferment of headcount ? didn?t find favour with the government and the House chair. Checks and balances enshrined in parliamentary processes must be given their due respect. In a truncated session, MPs have had little say in the two important legislations, promulgated as ordinances earlier. A select committee could have made suggestions and amendments palatable to the opposition and useful for the government. But that was not to be.

Reliance on a voice vote hasn?t helped the government either. This allowed the opposition to question the numbers in support of the bill. A contested passage doesn?t portend well for the Centre. It could increase resistance on the ground and give momentum to protests. That could in turn hold up more reforms that are keenly needed. Citing the divisiveness, opposing states could throttle the reforms, as has happened to many well-intentioned schemes.

Opposition?s attempt to create a spectacle of protest by heckling the deputy chairman at very close quarters, breaking a mic, and tearing official papers was crass and self-defeating. A race to the bottom with no winners is evident in Rajya Sabha TV arbitrarily muting the live feed before the House adjourned, purportedly to prevent airing of the commotion to a national audience, and the MPs recording their own shenanigans on smartphones. Far from impressing ordinary citizens, the political divisiveness is deeply distressing for them. Parliament must serve to reassure the public, uphold due process and serve as an oasis of calm, reasoned debate amid a worsening economic crisis.",Lost in chaos: An opportunity to present a farm reforms package through political consensus,The times of India,Neutral
12,Farm Bill,"Big changes are afoot in Indian agriculture, driven by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at considerable political risk. Freeing up farming markets may be as significant as dismantling industrial licenses in 1991. However, if the state?s protection withers away only to reveal a few large capitalists as the new overlords, there will be chaos and misery rather than progress and prosperity.

To gauge the scale of what?s being done, picture the depth of the stasis: 119 million cultivators and 144 million farmhands ? taken together, 10 times Australia?s population ? yoked to a marketplace designed to be anti-competitive, and denied the lift in productivity that propelled urbanization from Japan and South Korea to Taiwan and China.

?It?s like a massive old table in the center of the room, crawling with parasites.? That?s how Hemant Gaur, an entrepreneur who?s bringing technology to potato farming in India, describes to me the ?mandi,? or the designated market yard in which produce changes hands. ?We dared not discard it, because how would we ever replace it??

Finally, Modi has thrown out the old furniture by ramming legislation through parliament, passed by a dubious voice vote. Now growers don?t have to bring their harvests to the mandi. They can sell it at farm gates, factories, warehouses, silos, and cold storages. The market yard remains, but can?t charge any fee on transactions outside its physical space. Trades can take place online. Farmers can enter five-year, fixed-price contracts with corporate buyers. The government will tame only excessive price increases rather than impose caps on incremental jitters; free markets will be the rule.

The repercussions will reverberate across the world?s second-most populous country. India?s sheer size as a producer and consumer means ripples may also be felt as a long-term deflationary wave in global food prices.

Gaur?s SV Agri Pvt. operates at the intersection of technology and farming. It produces and markets seeds and inputs to farmers, buys back and stores their potatoes in modern warehouses before supplying firms that make crisps and snacks. In one stroke, the 2.5% mandi tax Gaur pays in Uttar Pradesh, India?s largest state, is gone. With the more efficient procurement that makes possible, he reckons on savings of up to 10%. The efficiency gains will be shared by farmers, processors and consumers. They?ll lead to more investments in cold chains, and less wastage, a huge problem.

But without the fees and commissions, the market yards may atrophy, and the local elite that?s thrived off the system but also buffered it could lose its sway, leaving farmers at the mercy of traders? cartels controlled by corporate monopolies. This could be particularly true in the grain-producing belt of Punjab and Haryana, where the percentage cut in mandi taxes and other levies is in double digits. No wonder that political opposition will be fiercest in these northern states.

Modi has gambled big before, with some disastrous results. It?s asking a lot of people in rural India to trust him again. The ban on most currency notes in 2016 was supposed to immobilize tax cheats. It froze the economy. His goods and services tax became a compliance nightmare. Opposition parties claim that the agricultural ?reform,? too, will fail, especially since freedom from the regulated yard in the poor eastern state of Bihar 14 years ago brought the market to the roadside, with no infrastructure and no open auction for price discovery.

Cultivators? biggest fear from deregulation is losing their most important bargaining chip: minimum prices guaranteed by the state. Modi has assured farmers the support will stay by announcing prices for the winter crop, though as farmer activists have noted, the 2.6% increase for wheat is only half the cost escalation.

The need of the hour is for farmers to establish large sales organizations of their own. If state support could give them bargaining power, they wouldn?t be selling cotton to private traders for a quarter less than the guaranteed minimum. How will Modi assure base prices once the mandi system slips into disuse? The professionally run dairy cooperative in Gujarat, the prime minister?s home state, has $5 billion in annual revenue from its Amul brand of milk, butter and cheese. But that movement took shape in a very different political firmament of the 1960s, and it didn?t succeed everywhere or in all commodities.

With all the risks involved, a new farm-to-fork model is still worth it. Boosting agricultural productivity is important for societies to reach the ?Lewis turning point.? Beyond that threshold posited by the economist Arthur Lewis, surplus rural labor ceases to be a drag on urban wages and living standards. Japan got there by nearly tripling per capita output between 1950 and the early 1960s, thanks to the shakeup from General Douglas MacArthur?s postwar land reforms. After independence from the British, India missed its chance to give land to tillers, and allowed absentee landlords to remain backseat drivers of policy.

Almost 9 out of 10 Indian farmers have less than five acres. A majority carry on reluctantly, barely able to scratch out a living. Landless labor is paid to stay in villages with a rural job guarantee from the taxpayer. The pressure of feeding India?s 1.3 billion people has led to suboptimal choices, like a water-guzzling rice crop grown in abundance in Punjab that bleeds aquifers dry. The burning of the paddy residue causes unbearable pollution in New Delhi.

Expected 20-fold growth in online grocery sales over the next five years is the surest shot to end the stifling status quo, provided farmers can unite and hold their own in negotiations with aggregators. With the Covid-19 lockdown hollowing out urban production centers, the rural economy has become more crucial. But free markets should also be fair. Otherwise, India?s farmers will crawl out of a hole only to land in a ditch.","With farm bills, Modi has thrown out old furniture. It was about time",Bloomberg,NDA
13,Farm Bill,"Can the government guarantee that India won?t go the US agri-business way due to these reforms? If the implementation fails, no one can safeguard our farms.

Did our Rajya Sabha pass the farm bills in a high-handed manner? The live-stream this Sunday from the Upper House managed to record the voice vote, but bowdlerised the protests by a united Opposition altogether.

As parliament opened India?s farm-gates or business, the Opposition from Shiromani Akali Dal to Biju Janata Dal to Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam were quick to chant, ?corporatisation?, ?cartelisation? and ?East India Company?. 

It was Pratap Singh Bajwa, an MP from Punjab, who set the tone by saying that the current bill will destroy marginal and small farmers. Other opposition MPs, namely Binoy Viswam of the Communist Party of India, went on further to say this bill favours ?Monsanto, Walmart and Reliance, etc.,? and concluded by stating, ?FDI culture will finish Indian agriculture.? 

But are these fears valid?

The US bent 
The farm bills are an extension of Niti Aayog?s Doubling Farmers Incomes (DFI) report. And by opening farm-gates for corporations, Modi is applying Uncle Sam?s playbook to Indian farmers, aiming to woo ?agri-dollars? into India. Hence the government has laid stress on FDI too.     

But this shouldn?t come as a surprise as since the Green revolution, the United States has deeply influenced Indian agricultural policy. This has been done directly through collaborations in creating the Seed Act, 1966, etc and more covertly through bullying at WTO on tariffs, MSP, and imports. 

On a closer read, one can see the DFI report paraphrasing many US policy documents such as the Committee on Economic Development?s (CED) ?An Adaptive Program for Agriculture?, on issues such as ?moving cultivators to non-farm jobs?.

By opening farm-gates for corporations, Modi is applying Uncle Sam?s playbook to Indian farmers. Photo: Reuters

Mind you these policies are already at play as Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant in a recent article called it ?watershed moment for agriculture as 43% of our workforce is unshackled? due to these reforms.  He is merely echoing conclusions of the CED report. 

But that is not all. On July 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave an open invitation to US agri-business companies to invest in India after ?the historic reforms?. 

Professor Ram Gopal Yadav, an MP from Uttar Pradesh, even made acerbic remark on Sunday, saying that no farmer?s son could have created these pieces of legislation. 

The BJP?s own BKS General Secretary Badri Narayan Chaudhary made a similar comment stating ?legislation has been drafted by people who are not aware of the grassroots reality.?

NSSO data from 2016 peeks into these realities and reports that the average Indian farm household earns as little as Rs 6,426 per month. The average monthly surplus of a rural household (farm and non-farm) is mere Rs 1,413 per month. Individual farmers earn about one-tenth of a  daily wage labourer?s income. 

And reportedly, average agricultural household debt was Rs 1,04,602 versus Rs 76,731 of non-agricultural households in 2017 ? agricultural households earn a frugal 2,500 above the rural debt median. 

Chasing the agri-dollar dream

By 1930, Iowa lost half its  farms due to the crisis. Farm prices fell more than 50%. 

Agriculture was the main occupation, and so a New Deal was introduced for farmers, which promised price support on important crops such as cotton, corn, wheat ? similar to our MSP system ? to protect the farmers against market forces. 

In about 20 years, the program was left for dead under fiscal concerns and market pressures.   

The US government, to galvanise rural incomes, then created financial and credit institutions offering easy loans to farmers for machinery and purchase of more land. A new system of contracting was also undertaken by the broiler industry, backed by feed dealers, etc. A push for diversification into livestock, high value crops, etc. was also backed US government loans.

Sound similar to the Rs 8.5 lakh crore agri-stimulus package COVID-19 stimulus given by the Modi government?

Riding on easy loans, stressed US farmers were quick to buy more land, farm equipment and modernise. In fact, for some years, the yearly land inflation price overtook bank investments. Overall, business was good, but this ascent was artificially sustained through lax fiscal manipulation. Speculation was high and credit was being used to refinance other mortgages. This caused a financial crash.  

The result ? between 1950 and 1970, real farm income decreased from $18 billion in 1950 to $13 billion in 1971. The number of farms also decreased by 50%, but the income per farm rose by 46% against the national average of 76%. Total mortgage debt on American farms rose from $8 billion in 1950 to $24 billion in 1971. 

It was then that Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz gave a call-to-arms. ?Either you got big? and doubled your income ?or got out? of farming. By then it was already too late for small and medium family farms, the financial bubble had burst. In 1983 as the farm crisis erupted, net farm income dropped to $14.2 billion from its previous record of $34.4 billion in 1973. Livestock farmers ? cattle and hog, were destroyed in the crisis. Thousands of farms and in particular small and family run farms were being foreclosed, while the size of the average farm grew.

Iowa reported an increase of rural child abuse by 43.6% between 1982 and 1986. Meanwhile 1982, a handful of agri-business companies owned and controlled over 95% US corn and wheat, 90% of US oats, 80% of all sorghum leaving the US, and business was never better for them. 

Dan Morgan?s Merchants of Grain, describes how a few agri-businesses created an oligopoly owing grain cars, elevators to rural banks, investment firms, insurance, etc using many sub companies to trap each dollar the farmer spent ? whether on seeds, fertilisers or food. They are the creditor, seller and buyers, all in one.

Surprisingly, Howard Zinn?s People?s History of the United States records that southern tenant farmers were forced to buy only from company stores and given company store credits instead of paper money post the Civil war. In 1870, 90% of Texan farmers lived on credit. 

Back to 2020, US has about 2 million farms, a $425 Billion farm debt, farm income declining by 50% and the American male farmers committing suicide two times higher than his non-farm counterpart. 

The four top agribusiness corporations control 84% of all the US food supply and over 70% of the world?s grain. Rural America is ravaged by economic despondency, an opioid crisis, domestic violence and mental illness. 

The American farm dream has earned billions of agri-dollars but by making millions of US farm families? expendable commodities.  

Neo-Company Raj 
With the new agricultural reforms, Indian farms are now open for these behemoth agri-business firms. They have already digested farmers of Brazil, Argentina and so on. And they have had a taste of Indian Dal too. In 2015,  an investigation by the I-T department revealed that despite the Essential commodities act, agri-business firms caused the Rs 2.5 lakh crore Dal scam. With the ECA amendment, the culprits have been absolved. 

Sooner or later the government will need an ordinance to free land ceilings as the success of US-influenced policy depends on big farms and minimal farmers. A recent USDA report predicts that ?competitive forces will likely continue to reduce the number of small commercial farms and shift production to larger farms.? Land concentration will only increase in the US. 
Can the government guarantee that India won?t go the US agri-business way due to these reforms? God forbid if the implementation fails, no one can safeguard our farms, annadattas and food system from a Neo-Company Raj.  ","Farm Bills, Small Farmers and Chasing the Agri-Dollar Dream ",The Wire,
14,Farm Bill,"As two of three important farm bills that seek to deregulate the sale of agricultural produce were passed in Rajya Sabha on Sunday, after all three were cleared by Lok Sabha earlier in the week, the story so far: Scenes of uproar and chaos amid an Opposition protest inside the Upper House, street agitations by farmers who are defying restrictions imposed by the pandemic in Punjab and Haryana, a walkout by the sole minister of one of the BJP?s oldest partners, SAD, from the NDA ministry. What should have been a moment to pause and prepare for moving towards a much-promised reform, is now one that ranges the intended beneficiaries against it, alongside the government?s political opponents and an ally. And for this disfigured and disfiguring moment, the government cannot blame the Opposition alone. While the opposition parties may be seizing the visible unrest in sections of the farmers to score a political point, the fact is that the government has wielded a bludgeon when it could have used the subtle powers of Parliament. In fact, the forcible ramming through of the farm bills, the stubborn refusal to concede any elbow room to the Opposition, be it a discussion, a division of votes or a reference to a select committee, underlines a sobering message ? this government may be in its second term, but it does not appear to have as yet understood the importance of Parliament, and of playing by its rules.

In Parliament, and outside it too, it often seems that the government believes that the winner takes all. In a constitutional democracy, however, there are, there must be, checks and balances, spaces for the political opponent and respect for the minority. There must be an attempt to moderate differences and forge common ground ? and the greater onus for this is on the government. Already, amid the pandemic, parliamentary schedules have been truncated. But if the government uses the abbreviated time only to push through legislation ? be it the consequential and crucial farm bills or The Industrial Relations Code Bill, 2020, which could water down the rights and protections of workers in small establishments ? giving short shrift to the need to listen to the suggestions of the people?s representatives or answer the Opposition?s questions, it would be reducing the nation?s highest deliberative forum to a mere clearing house. In an unprecedented pandemic, amid an economic downturn like no other, and with a grave face-off with China on the border, this short-circuiting of debate, and denial of the opportunity for MPs and Opposition to have their say, shrinks the possibilities of democracy to find a way out.

Of course, the farm bills do not merit the fears they appear to have stoked. Only the monopoly of the APMCs is sought to be dismantled, not the MSP regime. In any case, amid the pandemic, government will continue to be top procurer of agricultural produce, the bills will only put in place an enabling architecture for a later much-needed reform. This simple message needs to be communicated. But for it to be heard out, the government will first have to show that it is willing to listen.","Bully & Pulpit

15,Farm Bill,"Punjab and Haryana, the breadbaskets of India, took the lead as farmers across the country took the streets on Friday to protest against the Centre's three contentious farm bills, which were recently passed by the Parliament.

As many as 31 farmer organisations, under ageis of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) joined hands for the complete shutdown of Punjab. Among farmers' unions which are supporting the bandh call included Bharti Kisan Union Krantikari, Kirti Kisan Union, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and BKU (Lakhowal).

Farmers at several places in Punjab started gathering at roads for stopping the movement of traffic. Women protesters under the banner of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee in Amritsar took out a protest march. Shops and commercial establishments at many places in Punjab remained shut on Friday morning in the wake of farmers' stir. Shopkeepers had promised to keep their shops shut in support of farmers.

In Punjab, farmers also started a three-day rail blockade against the bills and squatted on tracks at many places.

The protesters have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm reforms would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system and they would be at the ""mercy"" of big corporates. The farmers said they would continue their fight till the three farm bills were revoked.

Farmer groups in Haryana urged residents to observe a bandh from 10 am to 4 pm on Friday. However, the National Highways were exempted from the bandh call. Several organisations in Haryana, including the BKU, also extended support to the nationwide strike called by some farmers' bodies against the bills.

The Delhi-Amritsar highway was blocked at several places by farmers from the BKU and the Revolutionary Marxist Party of India. The Haryana farmers also blocked the Rohtak-Jhajjar road. Protests were also held at several places, including Rewari and Yamunanagar.
  
In National Capital Regoion, hundreds of farmers gathered on a key road in Noida in Uttar Pradesh, prompting deployment of police in riot gear that kept them from proceeding towards Delhi.

The farmers were at the Noida Gate in Sector 14A near Chilla, at the UP-Delhi border, where they were stopped by the Gautam Buddh Nagar police around 12 noon, officials said.

""Today's protest is part of a bigger statewide and nationwide agitation by farmers against the farm-sector-related bills passed in Parliament recently. The farmers are opposed to these 'black laws'. Our demand is that a law should be made that fixes the MSP (minimum support price) as the lowest amount for purchasing crops from farmers,"" BKU's Meerut Zone president Pawan Khatana said.

Elsewhere, farmers in Karnataka staged demonstrations across the state on Friday as part of a 'bandh' call given to protest the 'anti-farmer' policies of the Central and state governments. A large number of ryots from various parts of the state flocked to the state capital to take part in the demonstrations to register their protest against the amendments to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act and the Karnataka Land Reforms Act.

The protesters called these amendments 'anti-farmer' and alleged that some people in power brought them to converttheir black money into white. A group of farmers blocked the busy Tumakuru road near Yashwantpur in the city. Demonstrations were also held in other places, including Mysuru and Davangere.
Opposition backs protests

While the ruling Congress in Punjab and the AAP extended support to the farmers' protest in Punjab, the Shiromani Akali Dal announced road blockades. Punjab CM Amarinder Singh had already promised that and no FIRs would be registered for violation of Section 144, which bars assembly of more than four people.

In Bihar, RJD leader Tejaswi Yadav rode a tractor along with party supporters during 'Bharat Bandh' in Patna. Various Left wing parties too held protests on the roads of Patna. Similar scenes were witnessed in Jharkhand's capital Ranchi as well as Kolkata and Guwahati.
The principal Opposition party, Congress, alleged that the new agriculture laws will ""enslave"" farmers and the MSP will be ""snatched away"" from them.

""A flawed GST destroyed MSMEs. The new agriculture laws will enslave our farmers,"" former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted with the hashtag ""I Support Bharat Bandh"".

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi also hit out at the government, saying the three farm bills brought by it are reminiscent of the ""East India Company rule"".

The MSP (minimum support price) of the farmers will be ""snatched away"" and they will be forced to become slaves of billionaires through contract farming, Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. ""Neither will they get the price nor respect. Farmers will become labourers in their own land,"" she alleged.",Farmers across India rise up against Centre's farm bills; Opposition backs protests,Deccan Chronicle,
16,Farm Bill,"The unity in the House, for once, was admirable but without a sustained campaign on the ground, visuals are futile

In the end, a moral victory is inconsequential, simply because it doesn?t change the facts on the ground. As noted American satirist HL Mencken said, ?In human history, a moral victory is always a disaster, for it debauches and degrades both the victor and the vanquished.? So though, for once, the Opposition seemed to have got its way in meeting the President over the farm Bills and was united against the Government?s gross subversion of parliamentary procedures in rushing through them in the Rajya Sabha by a voice vote despite lacking the numbers, what stops the new laws? The President is not likely to withhold assent or send the Bills back except granting an audience. Even if he were to do so hypothetically, they would be passed again, with or without any amendments, as the ruling BJP has an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha and has already set a precedent of passing debatable Bills by voice vote without discussion, deliberation or consensus. Besides, the President is not bound to act within a time-frame. And the way more Bills were passed even as the entire Opposition stayed away from the House in protest, it looks like the ruling party has no compunction in reducing an august institution to a stamping authority. So Opposition members can speak and cry hoarse all they want but cannot seek solace in parliamentary procedure or vetting by committees to stop motivated laws from being enacted. And when it comes to street fights, last year?s general elections showed us how the members of the grand anti-BJP alliance frittered away their best intentions to their selfish, regional interests. Till that cohesiveness congeals as a single movement, there cannot be any hope for the Opposition.

Worryingly, the Upper House passed three key labour reform bills that ought to have been discussed and debated given their sensitive nature. The Government has enough numbers in the Lok Sabha to override dialogue and even if outnumbered in the Rajya Sabha, it knows it can hijack debate by provoking the Opposition enough and use a voice vote in the resultant din. Or simply take advantage of a boycott. The three Bills relate to new labour codes on industrial relations, social security and occupational safety, all in the name of easing business while diluting workers? rights. Nobody expects the Government to be unreasonably welfarist but in a post-pandemic economy that has witnessed record joblessness, it allows companies with up to 300 workers to fire staff without government permission. The Government, however, feels that this would actually encourage employers to hire more than the previous limit of 100 and, in fact, create jobs. But employers in stressed times are hardly expected to be altruistic and given that our unorganised labourers comprise a big chunk of the country?s workforce, they continue to be exposed to vagaries of market forces. The Rajya Sabha also passed the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020, which ostensibly provides a framework under which organisations in India can receive and utilise grants from foreign sources. This is an umbrella watch on what is unsuitable to this Government the most, namely NGOs, research organisations, think tanks and civil society activists. And the carefully enunciated regulatory mechanism envisaged by the Bill, of course, remains vague about the conditions under which it can be used, lumping them as anything that is detrimental to ?national interest.? Nobody denies the need for greater transparency when it comes to activities sponsored by foreign sources but would that also be used to vet the PM Cares Fund, which is currently exempted under FCRA, or selectively be applied to ?anti-national? NGOs? Or does the Government believe that NGOs shouldn?t exist to point out gaps in its policies and implementation? Besides, most of these organisations have a high record of tax compliances over the years but by making Aadhar and SBI bank accounts mandatory for receipts, the Bill implies tighter controls and increased transaction costs, which are meant to create more impediments. This is just a way to stifle and discourage independent voices than a clean-up as is being proposed. It is the same kind of doublespeak that is latent in the farm Bills. On the face of it, they look reformist, dismantling the heavily cartelised Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and middlemen, and allowing farmers freedom of movement and trade. Question is some of them do not have the investable resources or the expertise for an outreach beyond their geographic limits and would have to depend on ?traders? or the corporations. The smaller and marginal farmers are not literate or educated enough and would not be able to counter the heft of corporations in negotiations and price fixing. In that sense, they could still end up being exploited as before. The farmers fear that in an open, competitive market, they would not get the minimum support price (MSP) that the Government promises to continue and given the diversity and multiplicity of markets, the guaranteed official procurement would be hit over time. Besides, nowhere do the Bills insist on the MSP as a criterion of farm pick-ups by ?traders? and ?sponsors.? They would, therefore, still be in crisis and at the mercy of the dictates of marketers. Besides, the proposed laws are still vague on defining the mechanisms that would replace the regulated economy. This kind of obfuscation has become so familiar that it is in danger of becoming the norm than the exception. And without Question Hour in Parliament, it?s time the questions are asked on the streets. The farmers? ire may just be the beginning of the next electoral plank.",Opp conundrum,The Pioneer,UPA
17,Farm Bill,"On Sunday, the Rajya Sabha passed The Farmers? Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. This newspaper has supported the government?s efforts to bring about a new legislative and policy architecture for agriculture as a method to empower farmers. But as far as legislation is concerned, there is both content and process. And on Sunday, there is little doubt that the process was undermined, reflecting poorly on India?s parliamentary democracy.

The reforms are significant, affecting a range of stakeholders, particularly farmers. They have also generated a political backlash, with even partners in the ruling coalition such as the Shiromani Akali Dal resigning from the Cabinet on the issue. The Opposition was keen on sending the bills to a select committee. Ideally, this should be done ? for the committee process provides an opportunity to examine legislation, refine it, and allows parliamentarians to speak up without being confined to party positions. But if the government was not willing to embark on that process, there should have been a discussion in the House where members got a chance to offer their perspectives and the government listened to feedback and made modifications accordingly. And along with this, there should have been a clear voting process ? a division as it is called in parliamentary parlance ? to get an accurate sense of the mood of the House.

Unfortunately, none of this was done. The discussion in the House was rushed ? since the government wants to push through other legislations quickly, before the session is brought to an early end. And there was no division, but a voice vote ? prompting genuine questions about whether the government had the numbers at all. So it was with one eye on the clock and another eye on the numbers that the government rushed through the process on Sunday ? but this was wrong.

The Opposition was wrong too ? in being disruptive, creating a din, tearing documents, and creating a difficult situation for the presiding officer, perhaps indicating that it too was not confident of the numbers. The responsibility for what happened on Sunday rests with both sides. The government?s victory in getting the bills passed will be tainted by the way it was done, and the Opposition?s response will dilute its legitimate right to protest.",The govt?s rush to pass key farm bills and the Opposition?s conduct were wrong,The Hindustan Times,Neutral
18,Farm Bill,"This is one more instance where the Centre has cocked a snook at the whole concept of cooperative federalism
A furious debate has broken out in the political salons of Delhi, corporate boardrooms and the farmlands of the country over the latest wave of reforms that the Narendra Modi government has unleashed with a stack of legislations that professes to free farmers from the tyranny of over 2,000 corruption-ridden wholesale markets where middlemen have robbed them blind for decades. The three pieces of legislation passed in the Lok Sabha have created a framework designed to usher in contract farming in a big way, catalyse the creation of large cold chain storage facilities and logistic networks, and shake off stockholding restrictions that were designed for an era of shortages. The broad contours of the reforms have a seductive appeal: they will remove the fetters on the farmers by giving them the opportunity to plug into a barrier-free common market for agriculture produce. They will ostensibly allow them to secure a fair price without having to worry about an unsold crop and wastage.

But the big beef over the reforms is that they have been introduced without any consultative process with the states or the various stakeholders. This is one more instance where the Centre has cocked a snook at the whole concept of cooperative federalism. Agriculture is a state subject, and the states have exercised a measure of control over farm supplies. That is now being broken and replaced by a system where the levers of control will pass to large business houses, which can now buy farm produce in bulk directly from the farmers and not worry about any stockholding restrictions. This could have a huge impact on price discovery and it is hard to say just yet whether it will deliver the desired outcomes.

The Centre has tried to sell the idea of reforms by suggesting that the new laws would ensure that farmers will be paid for their produce within three days of the sale ? an assurance that the old mandi system could never provide. But questions have rightly been raised about the inadequacy of the dispute resolution mechanism in protecting farmers? interests in an unequal battle with large corporates. The powers of dispute resolution have been delegated to magistrates and district collectors rather than specially designed agriculture tribunals. There remains a legitimate fear that the entire reform process is a thinly-disguised plan to favour a few crony capitalists while professing to create a brave new world for farmers. The objective is noble and may work in theory but it could well flounder in practice. There is a great danger that New India might be trading in an old, home-grown wheeler-dealer network for a new, swashbuckling bunch of buccaneers, leaving the farmer just as destitute as he is now.",Farms in ferment: Parliament passes farmer bills,The Telegraph,
19,Pradhan Mantri Jandhan Yojna,"In rural areas 44 per cent of the households and in urban areas 33 per cent of them still do not have a bank account.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, a major socio-economic initiative of the National Democratic Alliance government, was announced by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day speech. It is an ambitious attempt at extending formal financial services in a country where only 58.7 per cent of an estimated 24.67 crore households avail themselves of banking services. Despite several steps taken by many governments over the years, financial inclusion has remained elusive. In rural areas 44 per cent of the households and in urban areas 33 per cent of them still do not have a bank account. The NDA government has brought a degree of urgency to the scheme of financial inclusion. A few details of the government?s action plan figured in the budget speech. A Comprehensive Financial Inclusion Plan (CFIP) envisaging coverage of excluded households has been drawn up and is expected to be rolled out under the nomenclature. In its first phase, the Jan-Dhan Yojana will endeavour to provide universal access to all the beneficiaries through sub-service areas (SSA), each of them consisting of 100-150 families in a cluster of villages. Each SSA will be serviced by a business correspondent, who is now being given a pivotal role in facilitating account opening and ensuring smooth bank operations. Unlike in previous action plans, the Jan-Dhan Yojana will have as its focus households rather than geographical areas.

The other important innovation is in extending need-based credit facilities to the new account holders upon their fulfilling certain conditions. A smart card ? the Ru Pay card ? will be issued. Using this it should be possible for customers to operate their accounts without any external help. This would be one of the most visible manifestations of technology as a tool to further inclusion, others being money transfers through mobile telephones, e-KYCs and cash management by banks to extend their services over such wide areas. Insurance companies will be asked to offer micro-finance packages including insurance. Obviously there are major challenges. Even if operational obstacles can be overcome, there is the important question of keeping the first-time bank account holders engaged. Experience suggests that a high proportion of such accounts are hardly used after the initial enthusiasm wears off. The plan of inclusion, which is part of the Prime Minister?s vision of a Digital India, requires all-round support. The government wants to use these accounts for routing cash transfers in lieu of subsidies for essential commodities. Financial inclusion in that sense is therefore much more than extending banking services. Accompanied by an equally ambitious programme of spreading financial literacy, it can achieve many important socio-economic objectives.",An ambitious plan for inclusion,The Hindu,
20,Pradhan Mantri Jandhan Yojna,"Move to increase financial inclusion is welcome. But we need to debate the mechanisms.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an ambitious plan for financial inclusion during his Independence Day speech: the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. The PMJDY intends to provide a bank account, overdraft facility and basic insurance coverage for all households. At present, nearly 40 per cent of the country does not have access to financial services. In this context, moves to increase financial inclusion are welcome. There is, however, a need to debate the mechanisms through which it can be achieved. Access to finance is a service, not a good (bank account). Providing access to financial services may, therefore, require a different approach from, say, providing food items to the poor.

The PMJDY broadly follows the same centrally planned approach to financial inclusion that is practised by the RBI. This approach has not been successful. A recent survey found that nearly half of all business correspondents were untraceable, and 16 per cent of traceable BCs had not conducted any relevant activities. There is, therefore, a need to identify what financial inclusion really means. The central planning model seems to revolve around opening bank accounts. Households, however, have diverse financial portfolios, not all of which can be addressed through providing bank accounts. Payment systems such as Airtel Money and Paypal, for example, address a market demand that bank accounts do not. Similarly, different consumers require different levels of insurance, and for different things. A one-size-fits-all approach through central planning does not address the complex suite of financial services that households require.

In a marked difference from the past, the PMJDY emphatically puts the financial resources of the Central government behind this scheme. The government has also stated that the scheme is intended to aid direct benefits transfers for various social welfare programmes. To fulfil the broader mandate of financial inclusion, however, lessons could be gleaned from the revolution in the telecommunication sector in India, for instance, which did not happen through a mandate driven approach. Initially, call rates were high and access was limited. The natural operation of market forces and the government?s decision to encourage competition allowed for the current levels of mobile penetration. Today, telecom services encompass a complex gamut of services for customers. A similar approach towards financial inclusion is required, and regulators need to move towards a regime of greater competition.",Not just bank accounts,The Indian Express,
21,CAA,"The Centre must stop privileging religious persecution over other forms
As protests continue to ripple in many parts of the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or the CAA, the National Population Register (NPR) and allied issues, their nature, content and direction have drawn critical attention. The introduction of a religious test for Indian citizenship through the CAA evoked widespread public indignation. Right-thinking people from all walks of life mobilised in a manner befitting a vibrant democracy, and several State governments and Assemblies have expressed reservations. Students have been in the forefront of protests that marked an awakening from a defeatist slumber of the country in the face of creeping majoritarianism. As the protests linger on, however, they appear to be sliding into the control of vested interests that work for religious polarisation. The discriminatory CAA targets Muslims, but the protests were driven by the wider civil society at the beginning. Incendiary speeches and slogans at anti-CAA protests, and even support for Islamist politics, have put non-sectarian opponents of the law in a difficult spot. Muslims have equal rights as all other citizens of India to assemble and protest, but reducing the CAA debate into a question of their rights alone is dishonour of the pluralist, inclusive Constitution of secular India. After the success in kindling a national debate on the issue which is now before the Supreme Court that will litigate its constitutionality, anti-CAA protesters must now hold their fire.

The opportunity that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sniffed in the protests is not to reach out and reconcile, but to confront and polarise, particularly in the campaign for the Delhi Assembly election. The chilling effect of the party?s brazen vilification and dehumanisation of the protesters is no longer an abstract fear. Three separate incidents of firing at protesters, two clearly inspired by Hindutva politics, have been reported in Delhi. Far from condemning these incidents in the strongest terms and ensuring swift and strict police action, the BJP leadership has continued with divisive rhetoric. A Union Minister led slogans calling for the ?shooting of traitors?. The BJP must immediately adopt a path of reconciliation and resolution. One way is by making a further amendment to the CAA that will not prioritise religious persecution over other forms of persecution. No protester is against welcoming the persecuted from three neighbouring countries listed in the CAA. By amending the law to remove the arbitrary selection of countries and religious groups, the current turmoil can be easily calmed. A small step of reason and vision will serve India well.",Need of the hour: On CAA protests,The Hindu,
22,CAA,"Amid unending turmoil over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens, Centre has sanctioned funds for the National Population Register exercise with the explicit promise that it is not linked to the divisive NRC. Rhetoric on NRC has been dialled down, but the relief has proved short lived with NPR sparking fresh worries. For one, the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, leave little to imagination that a Population Register could be a precursor to finalising a ?National Register of Indian Citizens?.

Equally alarming are the 2003 rules which allow anyone to raise objections to entries in the ?Local Register of Indian Citizens? at the taluk/ sub-district level. It raises the prospect of genuine citizens in a document-poor country like India being subjected to harassment and witch hunts from neighbours, politically motivated groups, and a dysfunctional lower bureaucracy.

BJP looks out on a limb with this one, as it finds it difficult to convince even its allies, let alone the opposition, that all these enumeration exercises in conjunction with CAA will do more good than harm. Akali Dal now wants Muslim refugees also included in CAA after supporting the legislation in Parliament. Similarly, Assam?s AGP supported CAA in Parliament but is now singing a different tune. Others like JD(U) and BJD, which also supported CAA, are pushing back against NRC. All these parties were mum earlier, despite CAA-NRC?s discriminatory and bureaucratic character as well as NRC?s apparent failure in Assam having been pointed out. While they should have exercised due diligence, BJP should now pay heed and listen to the protesting voices.

But that isn?t happening yet going by Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s rebuke of the violent protests and unqualified backing for UP police. Videos of the violence implicate both sides. With police constraining the space for peaceful protests the danger of grievances manifesting as violence grows. Acts like booking 1,200 people at Aligarh Muslim University for a candlelight protest mustn?t be repeated. 21 shooting deaths in UP alone are excessive. Many states have said they will not cooperate in these enumeration exercises. A gaping trust deficit is accompanying the gathering storm and it portends misery, chaos and economic ruin. Let?s pull back from this chasm, and focus the nation?s attention instead on what the IMF has billed as the surprising magnitude of India?s slowdown. What the country needs is jobs and economic growth, not ?maximum government?.",NPR?s turn: CAA and NRC have created a trust deficit. It?s difficult for NPR to now pass muster,The times of India,
23,CAA,"There are signs of a nationwide outrage building up over Tuesday?s cross-country arrests under the heavy-handed Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act ? generally used for dangerous terrorists ? of five prominent intellectual dissidents, including poets, lawyers who take up the causes of the marginalised, and academics. The challenge to this came swiftly on Wednesday with five prominent academics and human rights advocates moving the Supreme Court against the ?mala fide arrests? that criminalise dissent. The court has ordered only house arrests for now, while the matter is being heard.

There have been strong sectional mobilisations against the government so far ? of farmers, or on the communal question typified by cow vigilante actions and lynch mob attacks. The current mood of popular resentment is different. It?s over trampling of civil liberties by the State as the police dragged out eminent persons from their homes without giving coherent reasons ? pretty much gangster-style.

Those arrested include famous people?s balladeer Varvara Rao, 79, of Hyderabad, and Faridabad-based National Law School (Delhi) visiting professor and human rights and trade union activist Sudha Bhardwaj.

The arrested dissenters, each with a long record of working with the poor, have been labelled ?urban Naxalites? in order to tarnish them, but it?s not clear what the charge against them is. Very loosely, it?s being suggested through friendly TV channels that a plot to assassinate the Prime Minister is being unravelled and ?incriminating ? documents and close surveillance reveal these figures are likely to be associated.

The idea of their association with such a plot, if one exists, sounds preposterous, though not to the Pune police, which picked up the five individuals. Since none has been linked with violence and public disorder in their work going back decades, it?s plausibly being suggested their arrests are an example of the work of the ?thought police?. It?s expected such actions will help keep government critics at bay.

A contrast is being drawn with the way the far-right Sanatan Sanstha ? that was linked to the killings of rationalists like Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare of Pune and journalist Gauri Lankesh of Bengaluru, and at whose premises near Mumbai bombs and firearms were found ? has been treated so far, and the dramatic midnight knock-style arrests of government critics.

A plot against a high dignitary like the PM is a very serious matter and should be painstakingly investigated, and not bandied about on television in order to score political points. The Maharashtra police has failed in this regard. It has linked the eminent dissenters with the material supposedly found in June with another set of prominent dissenters said to be associated with a pro-dalit event in Pune on December 31-January 1. This was organised by Elgar Parishad, founded by retired Supreme Court judge P.B. Sawant. The entire thing seems bizarre.",Arrests of activists totally unjustified,The Asian age,
24,CAA,"The people of India have spoken up ? they will not allow the constitution to be subverted.

For weeks now, Indians have come out on the streets in unprecedented numbers. Not a single protestor is opposed to the grant of citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Instead they have declared in unison that religion cannot be a criterion for the grant of citizenship. Whatever the government says, that is precisely what the Citizenship (Amendment) Act does.

The prime minister has claimed that the National Register of Citizens ? which will divide Indians into ?citizens? and ?doubtful citizens? ? is not even at the discussion stage in official circles. His assurance is completely contradicted by home minister Amit Shah?s statements inside Parliament and outside that the exercise will be rolled out all over the country by 2024. Meanwhile, a renewed push is being made for the National Population Register (NPR), which has no raison d?etre except to serve as a data bank for the NRC.

The issue, however, is not that the two top-most government figures are saying opposing things. Nor should Modi?s word on this be considered final. It is a government?s responsibility to show the country a clear, consistent and consultative legal framework for any policy on this order of significance. Instead it continuously shifts, contradicts, denies its own claims ? broad and detailed ? and has only confirmed popular fears of its bad faith. As a result, only the formal withdrawal of the all-India NRC as a concept can assure the country that this horrendous exercise will not be taken up in the future.

Civil society and the public and large have understood this. That is why the protests have not slowed, and even the violence by the police in different parts of the country ? mainly in BJP-ruled states ? has not deterred citizens from coming out on the streets. Their principal demand is that the CAA be redrafted to offer citizenship to any bona fide refugee facing persecution in India?s neighbourhood. This simple redrafting will adequately cover refugees from the six communities the government says it is concerned about, without gratuitously listing them (and excluding others) in the text of the law. The fact that Modi and Shah are tone deaf to this elementary logic is proof that their aim is to polarise the country on religious lines and drag India further towards a ?Hindu rashtra?.

The illegal manner in which people have been denied the right to peacefully oppose the government?s move ? the misuse of Section 144, detentions and beatings, internet shutdowns ? has widened the ambit of the protests, which are no longer just about the CAA and NRC. In fact, the hundreds of thousands of citizens out on the streets, braving lathis and bullets, chanting slogans and singing songs and vociferously raising their voice against the government, are now fighting for the constitution, for India?s foundational principles, for their democratic rights.

From Assam to Kerala, from Mumbai to Kolkata and in Delhi, Lucknow and Mangalore, Kasargode, Vijayawada and Aurangabad, Indians, young and old, cutting across religion and caste, have come out to let the government know that they will not stay silent in the face of a brazen attempt to ride roughshod over India?s democracy.

For the past six years or so, the country has seen lynchings, rising intolerance and systematic attempts at silencing critics. Institutions of higher learning are under siege. Minority rights are under attack. The completely cynical way in which a long-standing arrangement with Kashmir has been subverted and an entire people suppressed has shocked the conscience of the world. Barring some voices of protest, however, many in India have remained quiet, mostly because they were too scared to speak out.

The CAA-NPR-NRC threat has changed all that. While the BJP privately tells its supporters that this ?trishul? is aimed at Muslims alone, the fact is that millions of Indian citizens are likely to have their lives upended by the party?s insistence that they prove their citizenship. As of today, the government has still not decided what the metric will be, but given bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption and sheer cussedness, ?mistakes? are bound to happen on a large scale. The list of ?doubtful citizens? that this enumerative excess eventually produces will almost entirely comprise the poor. Minorities will be the worst affected, because of the intent behind the exercise, but other marginalised sections will not be far behind.

The Modi government must read the public mood and step back. People do not want vague assurances any more. Nothing short of the complete scrapping of the NPR and NRC and the redrafting of the CAA to bring it in conformity with India?s constitutional principles and international law obligations will do.","The Protests are Not Just Anti-CAA, But Pro-Constitution",The Wire,
25,CAA,"The agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act appears to have gone through three phases. In the first phase, it was a protest against its enactment, as there were genuine apprehensions that the Act, followed by a pan-India NRC exercise, would lead to a large section of society, mostly Muslims, being declared illegal migrants/citizens. There was protests in Jamia Millia Islamia and large-scale demonstrations in Assam and other Northeast states. In the second phase, it became a confrontation between students and the police. Allegations of police high-handedness spread and there were sympathetic protests in educational institutions across the country. The CAA remained the trigger, but it was pushed to the background. Student anger was directed against the police and the government. In the third phase, which we are witnessing today, the movement has been hijacked by political opportunists, separatist factions, fundamentalist groups and lumpen elements. The CAA is an excuse; the target is the ruling party.

The government, in retrospect, appears to have seriously miscalculated the fallout of the CAA. Its success on three fronts appears to have made it insensitive to the simmering anger among the Muslim community. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which banned triple talaq, was a good measure for the emancipation of Muslim women from an atrocious practice, but it antagonised the radical elements. The abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, aggravated the discomfiture of Muslims. Then the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya added to the sense of unease. The canard that the judiciary had been influenced to give the disputed plot to the Hindus for the construction of the Ram temple, with some luminaries writing about the alleged flaws in the judgment, added fuel to the fire. All these three developments ? the annulment of triple talaq, the abrogation of Article 370 and the Ayodhya verdict ? collectively led to a feeling of anger, resentment and frustration among Muslims. The government either was not aware of the depth of Muslim resentment or was not bothered about it and was confident of being able to weather any storm.

The announcement of the National Population Register was unexceptionable, but it was ill-timed. Heavens would not have fallen if it had been delayed by a few months. It has provided further ammunition to the Opposition which has embarked on a disinformation campaign to mislead people.


The police are presently doing a thankless job. If they take action against the agitators, as they did in UP, there are allegations of high-handedness. If they play it safe, as they did in West Bengal, the agitators will have a field day ? destroy railway property, burn buses, attack police posts and indulge in acts of vandalism. It is indeed sad that in most of the states, the governments are not particularly bothered about the destruction of public and private property. The taxpayer?s money is nobody?s concern.

The Supreme Court had, in the context of state governments not taking effective measures to protect public and private property from being damaged by unruly mobs, constituted two committees, one headed by Justice K T Thomas and the other by F S Nariman, to study the problem. The Thomas Committee gave recommendations regarding the modalities for preventive action and for providing sharper teeth to inquiry/investigation. The Nariman Committee made suggestions regarding the assessment of damages. These were accepted by the Court which clearly said that ?the liability will be borne by the actual perpetrators of the crime as well as the organisers of the event giving rise to the liability? and that ?exemplary damages may be awarded?. Uttar Pradesh is perhaps the first state to have shown the political will to punish those who vandalised property.

The agitation has thrown up some disturbing questions. In UP, according to the police chief, there was a conspiracy to create disturbance. If so, one would like to know its full ramifications. Another senior police officer said that the pattern of protests in the state showed guerrilla tactics. The official version that the police did not open fire, and the fact that there have been deaths due to bullet injuries need to be reconciled. Reports about the involvement of Popular Front of India (PFI) in the agitation are a matter of grave concern and require in-depth investigation. The Karnataka home minister, speaking about the Mangaluru violence, stated that the attack on police was premeditated and the arson was orchestrated by anti-social elements. It would appear that the roots of the agitation go much deeper. Resentment against CAA was perhaps the proverbial last straw. But the movement has since degenerated into a confrontation between the government and diverse elements opposed to it.

The objections to the Citizenship Act are generally unconvincing. Assam is the only state which has reasons to feel aggrieved. There is substance in the argument that the Act contravenes Clause 6 of the Assam Accord which guaranteed safeguards to ?protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people?. Reservations on the NRC are understandable. While going ahead with the CAA, the government would do well to scrap the proposal to expand the NRC and explore the possibility of settling refugees in other states across the country which are willing to and in a position to absorb them.",The objections to the Citizenship Act are generally unconvincing,The Indian Express,
26,CAA,"As the year ends, by snatching Jharkhand from the BJP?s command, the Congress is probably having the last laugh. Anti-BJP protests and demonstrations across the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) have certainly punctured the larger-than-life image projected about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It has deflated electorally also in Jharkhand. Hopefully, the Jharkhand results will not make the Congress over-confident about its prospects in the forthcoming Assembly elections, particularly in Delhi. At present, the party needs to pay strategic importance to its anti-BJP campaign even if this demands an alliance with a regional party. Regarding Jharkhand, the Congress acted shrewdly by allying with a regional party prior to the Assembly elections than choosing to deliberate on its options after the declaration of the results. Besides, its protests against the CAA and the NRC has apparently not been ignored by voters.

Amit Shah needs to perhaps deliberate on his confidence about remaining in power for 50 years because of the 2019 parliamentary victory. One needs to view his 50-year ?obsession? from another angle. He may be around, but there is no guarantee that he?d still be in power.

There is also a severe temporal lapse in the BJP?s drafting of the NRC as well as the CAA. The selection of the year 1971 for registering citizens in keeping with the NRC, which has so far not extended beyond Assam, is fairly puzzling. The framers of the NRC presumed that they will take little time in implementing it beyond Assam. India is not Assam, nor is it just Gujarat or Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).

Some importance should also be given to this nation?s functioning in keeping with its Indian Standard Time. Everything does not get done in time here. So, I am wondering, by the time some designated officials land up at the houses of those born before 1971, on the basis of God knows which data, there is no guarantee that those persons would be around. Okay, digital technology is assumed to have made everything a lot faster. But it was not around in the 1970s and earlier. How will midwives (dais) responsible for the birth of many prior to the 1970s be traced? Also, I have not heard of midwives having kept any record of the births they assisted in. With respect to those born in hospitals prior to 1971, the possibility of their certificates being retrieved from there is as good as non-existent. Besides, there is the ?name? issue.

Nowadays, even a minor difference in spelling of names in various identity cards one is supposed to have can spell a major headache. Earlier, usually, only nicknames were decided at the time of birth. The birth certificates of many, if they exist, prior to the 1970s don?t have the same name which was later chosen formally. Most educated and urban Indians are at present loaded with too many identity cards and documents required for verification: Driving license, birth-certificate, educational certificates, passport, PAN card, bank-statement, proof of having paid income tax, voter-ID and of course the Aadhaar card. The last needs to be linked with registered mobile numbers, PAN cards, bank accounts and I am not aware if new rules would include some other documents, including verification by neighbours with documents to prove their identity.

It is really mind-boggling as to how many more identity cards each Indian is likely to be commanded to have. When Aadhaar cards were made compulsory, we ensured that all family members got theirs, by using the services of private agents. Since an elderly member was bedridden, the agent came home for his photograph, fingerprints, etc and his card was made. Earlier, the concerned government unit was approached to facilitate the same service. It took more than a year to respond and got in touch with us after the member had expired. This is just a mild indicator of the lapses still prevalent in the Indian system, because of which it is impossible to expect immediate, accurate as well as complete data to be officially recorded about each and every citizen.

This writer has also learnt of cases of the Aadhaar card displaying the incorrect gender. No person ? male, female, transgender or of any gender ? would like to be identified wrongly, gender-wise. Of course, these errors have been corrected but not instantly or just within a few days.

Even if the present leaders remain confident about the NRC and the CAA being prepared in 50 years, as per IST, why don?t they look into the future; and start keeping records from 2020 than waste money and time in digging up the past?

It may be wiser for the government to give some importance to keeping a record of the blood group of each citizen. It should. It must. This will save time when, God forbid, any person reaches the stage of needing blood supply. Blood group is not decided by race, religion, caste, class and/or any other ethnic division. All my family members have different blood groups. Being accident-prone, they have needed blood more than once. Who knows, which and how many Indian citizens? blood flows through my veins? I just know that it is Indian. Only in films, siblings with the same blood group turn up to save their parent from the jaws of death and thus get reunited.

The unity being voiced by Indians against the CAA and the NRC cannot be taken lightly. It is a wake-up call for all, including ones obsessed by a 50-year syndrome. And this is not a laughing matter.

There are two very conflicting versions of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act movement that are doing the rounds. Both need dispassionate scrutiny if we are to anticipate the future trends in Indian politics.

The first narrative would have us believe that the anti-CAA stir is essentially an uprising of civil society against a bid by the Narendra Modi Government to steer India towards a majoritarian state. According to this point of view, the CAA may seem innocuous at first glance but in effect prepares the groundwork for relegating Muslims to the status of second-class citizens. Although the way this argument has been translated into political messaging in the grassroots would suggest that Indian Muslims must henceforth prove their Indian citizenship with documentation, the more sophisticated of the anti-CAA concede that there is nothing in the laws for the state to undertake such a draconian exercise. Their contention is that it could happen and a pre-emptive strike to negate all discriminatory practices is imperative.

The second feature of this narrative is that the anti-CAA stir is presented as an uprising of civil society and includes a wide cross-section of society. In particular, it is held that students, Dalit organisations and all minority communities are involved in defeating the Modi Government?s project. It is also being held that the CAA is against the tenets of the Constitution and will be struck down by the Supreme Court after the hearings resume in April.

Initially, the parliamentary opposition was slow to react to the CAA. The hearings of the Select Committee weren?t marked by too much acrimony ? although dissenting notes were submitted. The Opposition believed that the main opposition to the CAA would happen in Assam and the North-eastern States and would be linked to the pre-existing disquiet against outsiders and all foreigners ? Hindus and Muslims. The Opposition felt that the real pressure on the Government would come from these areas and that the rest of the country would be largely unaffected. Certainly, there was no anticipation that the Muslim community would react so adversely to a legislation that was aimed at benefitting small communities of refugees. In hindsight, the Opposition has merely piggy-backed on a movement that has been initiated and nurtured by community organisations.

The alternative narrative presented by the Modi Government sees the CAA as attending to a long-standing issue centred on the loose ends of Partition. It has proceeded on the assumption that while illegal immigration from Bangladesh is difficult to contain, the issue would become more manageable and politically rewarding if a distinction could be made between refugees who had fled from religious persecution and those who had entered India for other regions. If the refugees were driven by a push factor, the infiltrators were pulled towards India by economic considerations.

Underlying this distinction between refugees and infiltrators was the unstated conviction that India was the natural homeland for all Hindus. The CAA, in effect, guaranteed a right of return to all Hindus of the subcontinent. Coming to the anti-CAA stir, the Government too was taken by surprise when Muslim protests erupted all over West Bengal on December 13 ? two days after Parliament passed the Bill ? and quickly spread to the Muslim-dominated campuses of Aligarh and Jamia Milia Islamia, Delhi. Hostile demonstrations were anticipated in Assam and the North-eastern States and the Government was prepared to meet these with a combination of persuasion and firmness. There does not appear to have been any corresponding strategy for the protests in the rest of India. Once the protests escalated, the narrative of the BJP and the Government shifted focus to the composition of the protests. The Government was always clear in its mind on two things.

First, that the composition of the demonstrations and the geography of the protests clearly indicated that it was a pre-planned Muslim uprising.

Secondly, it was also felt that the CAA was incidental to the protests. The Muslim community, it was felt, was smarting over the fact that in two successive general elections, the BJP and Narendra Modi had coasted to outright victory without any Muslim support. Modi had not only undermined the political clout of the Muslim community; he had added to the insult by enacting three laws that many Muslims felt were inimical to their community interests. The first was the triple talaq legislation, the first time Muslim personal laws were altered since 1940. The second was the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, a long-standing BJP election commitment that the pundits felt could never be implemented. Thirdly, there was the CAA which clearly distinguished between Hindu refugees and Muslim infiltrators. In principle, by stating that those who were deemed illegal immigrants were ineligible for citizenship, the CAA has left the door open for deportation of foreigners. The CAA also ruled out the possibility of India granting any form of asylum to Muslim Rohingyas fleeing Bangladesh. Finally, the simmering disquiet over the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case was waiting to find an outlet.

The Muslim community, in short, viewed the course of politics since 2014 as a series of defeats. The determination to reacquire political relevance found expression in the anti-CAA stir, aided and abetted by those who had other political scores to settle with the Modi Government.

What is being witnessed in today?s India is a sharply polarised environment based on two very different narratives. India is actually witnessing a sharply ideological division which won?t easily be resolved.  ",CAA protest is Muslims' pent-up ire against Modi,The Pioneer,
28,CAA,"The European Union (EU) Parliament is set to debate a clutch of resolutions on various policies of the Narendra Modi government, ranging from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) to the changes to Article 370. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government?s ideological push has generated domestic challenges, be it in the form of sullen anger among locals in Kashmir or the protests against the CAA. But it has also generated a major international challenge, with criticism about the weakening of democracy in India.

To be sure, the EU Parliament does not reflect the will of the independent, sovereign governments that make up the Union. Additionally, the resolutions and statements by Members of the European Parliament lack any binding authority. It is also true that India?s external adversaries, and ideologically driven groups, have often pushed exaggerated propaganda. And there can be no arguing that the issues that are discussed are India?s business. But the onus rests on Delhi to allay apprehensions. It cannot play up foreign points of view when favourable (remember it invited MEPs to Kashmir), and dismiss them as irrelevant when unfavourable. India needs to restore its image as a healthy democracy, committed to pluralism. Fix the product, and the messaging.",India needs to restore its image as a pluralist democracy,The Hindustan Times,
29,CAA,"The Union law minister has assured the nation that while there is a possibility of the National Register of Citizens being implemented, it would be done on the basis of rules defined after exhaustive consultation. If the sustained protests across the country against the NRC as well as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are any indication, India?s citizens remain deeply suspicious about the real intent of these measures. The contentious nature of the CAA, which seeks to redefine citizenship through a selective filter of faith, is one reason for the public outrage. The mixed signals coming from the top have also helped fan the flames. Earlier, the prime minister had said that talks of a pan-India NRC have not taken place. Narendra Modi, who seemed to be contradicting the views of his colleagues, including the home minister, is now, in turn, being contradicted by the Union law minister. If the claim of talks of a countrywide NRC, as Mr Modi said, is indeed speculative, how is it that the Union law minister spotted the ?possibility? of the NRC being imposed on the nation at some point?

Perhaps this is all a part of the Bharatiya Janata Party?s game plan. A smokescreen, the result of inconsistent pronouncements, is often useful to mask intent. It is the discriminatory nature of the CAA-NRC that makes such subterfuge necessary. The proposal is not just unconstitutional: providing citizenship on the basis of religion goes against constitutional tenets. What is equally objectionable ? this point seems to have got lost amidst the noise ? is that the NRC, the CAA cannot be looked at independently, proposes to shift the burden of proof of citizenship on citizens themselves. Why should Indians, most of whom possess relevant documentary evidence of some form, be made to experience the indignity of having to declare their place in the country to a government that has been elected by them? This is an inversion of the basic contract that binds citizens to their government. Yet, the BJP is convinced that electoral majority has given it the licence to subject the people, rather than its government, to tests of fidelity to citizenship or, as the disastrous demonetization exercise showed, to financial integrity. Ideally, in a democracy, the people are invested with the power to hold the government accountable. But in New India, it is the government that is attempting to render the people powerless in this respect.","NRC, CAA talk all upside down",The Telegraph,
30,Rafale Deal,"The price-redacted audit report on the process to acquire 36 Rafale fighter jets is unlikely to bring closure to the controversy over the deal. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India tabled in Parliament comes in the midst of a vigorous campaign by the Opposition that is questioning the process, based on media revelations about possible lapses and deviations and significant points raised by dissenting members of the Indian Negotiating Team (INT). The Modi government can draw comfort from the fact that the CAG report concludes that the 2016 agreement is slightly better in terms of both pricing and delivery than what was under negotiation in 2007 during the UPA regime. However, the report does not allay all doubts. Pegged at 2.86%, the price advantage in the contract over the 2007 offer is marginal. It is a far cry from the 9% saving claimed by the government. The delivery schedule is only one month sooner than the estimated outer limit in the earlier process. The CAG has found fault with Dassault Aviation being allowed to retain the gains made by the absence of a bank guarantee, which, if executed, would have come with significant charges. Disappointingly, the CAG has not quantified this amount, though it declares that it should have been passed on to the Defence Ministry. The 2007 price offered by Dassault included bank charges, and its absence in the 2016 contract is a clear benefit to the company. In other words, the ?advantage? is lower than the 2.86%.

While the key question of pricing is sought to be resolved by the CAG by comparing the auditors? aligned price with the INT?s computation, some issues remain unaddressed. The original issue of bringing down the total acquisition from 126 to 36 aircraft does not draw much comment. Also, the huge outgo on the India-Specific Enhancements (ISEs), despite the final figure being projected as a 17% saving on the aligned offer, is something that requires deeper examination. While auditing the earlier process, the CAG found that ISEs were upgrades allowed to be made so that Dassault?s bid would be compliant with qualitative requirements. Even a team of Ministry officials that examined in March 2015 the integrity of the earlier process concluded that ?the acceptance of [Dassault?s] additional commercial proposal after bid submission date... was unprecedented and against the canons of financial propriety.? Dassault was not the lowest bidder in the earlier process, and its technical bid had been rejected. Perhaps, this presented an opportunity to the present regime to reopen the entire process to buy Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) and invite fresh bids. However, it chose the IGA route with France, possibly for diplomatic reasons. The CAG identifies as a major problem the fact that the technical requirements are too narrowly defined for most vendors to comply with. The message from the report is that defence acquisition processes require reforms and streamlining.",The CAG report does not allay all doubts about the Rafale deal,The Hindu,
31,Rafale Deal,"With the tabling of the Comptroller and Auditor General?s (CAG) report on the Rafale fighter aircraft deal in Parliament, both BJP and Congress are claiming vindication. While the ruling party is pointing to the report?s finding that the fighter jet deal negotiated by it in 2016 was 2.86% cheaper ? per unit basis ? than the 2007 deal for the same aircraft that was being negotiated by the previous UPA regime, Congress is still hinting at impropriety because the report redacts the actual prices of the aircraft and associated components.

In fact, CAG itself finds comparing the two deals ? UPA?s 126 aircraft and NDA?s 36 aircraft ? quite challenging. Not only were the quantities different, the auditor also had to factor in price escalation over the intervening years as well as differences in the packages themselves. UPA?s 126 aircraft deal had a significant transfer-of-technology component unlike NDA?s 36 aircraft in flyaway condition. Nonetheless, the CAG report lays out the reasons for the cancellation of the UPA deal as Rafale?s French manufacturer Dassault Aviation refusing to provide guarantee for the aircraft that were to be produced by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and failure to determine the manpower cost of manufacturing in India. This setback after a 15-year procurement process had created a real crisis for the Indian Air Force whose fighter squadrons are fast depleting.

But BJP may have scored a self-goal when it declared after coming to power that it would get a better fighter aircraft deal. As the CAG report shows, three items of the new Rafale deal including the basic aircraft were procured at the same price as the old deal. It also indicates that the marginal price drop overall happened at the cost of removal of banking and performance guarantees, a standard feature of such contracts. Congress is bound to play this up, and political fisticuffs will continue.

On several matters, the Narendra Modi government has failed to answer the opposition?s questions clearly and unequivocally. To cite one of very many, why can?t the price of the Rafale jet be revealed to a select parliamentary panel, especially as estimates are widely available and cannot be tough to find out for anyone determined to dig? Opacity in the government?s arguments has enabled the opposition to look for advantage. Finally, if this is the tortuous path that every defence procurement has to take, it is a tragedy. A better defence procurement process needs to be worked out expeditiously for the sake of national security.","CAG?s Rafale report: Political fisticuffs will continue, India?s defence procurement is in a mess",The times of India,
32,Rafale Deal,"The report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) on the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France ? which has become a matter of deep controversy ? doesn?t provide satisfaction on points of discord. There can be little doubt that the CAG will need to expand its present effort to be more comprehensive if its work is to carry conviction. This should ideally happen before the next Parliament has a chance to debate its report. The report, presented to Parliament on Wednesday, fails to shed light on some key questions, first raised by Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who made serious allegations that were amplified by carefully documented and well-sourced reports in the media along with defence ministry documents.

The CAG report makes two principal assertions. The first is that the price contracted by the present government to buy 36 Rafale jets is 2.86 per cent cheaper than that negotiated to buy 136 of the same aircraft by the UPA government earlier. The basis for the calculation is not presented as the CAG has excised the price data. However, a media report by a credible defence analyst relying on sources involved in the negotiations suggests the price offered by Dassault Aviation in 2016 for 36 aircraft was 40 per cent higher than its offer in 2012 for 126 aircraft.  The package cost was 19.5 billion euros in 2012, and this included the cost of aircraft, technology transfer (to HAL, the then Indian partner), India-specific enhancements, weapons systems on board, spares and maintenance guarantees. This works out to Rs 1,000 crores per aircraft. In contrast, the 2016 price was Rs 1,600 crores per aircraft.

 

The second key point made by the CAG is that the delivery schedule offered in 2016 was five months quicker than the one proposed in 2012. For scrapping the UPA-era negotiations and signing a fresh contract by jettisoning HAL and introducing a practically-bankrupt Indian businessman into the proceedings, the Narendra Modi government cited the reasons of better price and faster delivery (to bolster security needs). But the CAG itself casts doubts on the government?s claimed five-month time advantage. It also criticises the government for not going for a fixed price formula, a point also made in a strong dissent note by the three ?domain experts? in the Indian negotiating team, and accepting the French formula of price escalation instead. To be comprehensive, the CAG should have referenced the dissent note, which carries multi-dimensional insights. The CAG report will also be found wanting for not alluding to the gross violation of Defence Purchase Procedure 2013 and 2016, which resulted in the PMO conducting ?parallel negotiations?, undercutting the official Indian negotiators, a point made by the then defence secretary in a note to then defence minister Manohar Parrkiar, allowing scope for possible legal action.",CAG?s Rafale report raises many questions,The Asian age,
33,Rafale Deal,"Examining the process of decision-making in a government involves ferreting out information, documents that need to be brought out from the dark, into the light, in public interest. This was true in the 1980s of Bofors, about kickbacks in a defence deal. Even governments have realised that records which are meant to be confidential are invaluable in bringing illegality to book. More recently, in 2016, the Panama Papers, the painstaking unveiling of offshore transactions in tax havens, resulted in hundreds of crores of undeclared assets being traced by the government. Now, in the Rafale case, for Attorney General KK Venugopal to raise an objection in court seeking dismissal of the review petitions on the ground that they cited documents ?stolen? from the defence ministry, for him to attempt to wield the Official Secrets Act as a shield against allegations of wrongdoing in the 2016 aircraft deal between India and France, is disappointing ? and outrageous. The question is not just, as the Chief Justice of India-led bench put it: What had the government done till now? After all, the first newspaper report, which the AG claims is based on stolen documents, was published a month ago, on February 8 in The Hindu. In her reply to the allegations against the government on the Rafale deal in Parliament, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not speak about a theft. The question, more importantly, is one that the bench also asked: ?Suppose there is a corruption complaint, are you going to shelve it under national security?? Is there a liberty to commit corruption??

The attempt to target the messenger and to criminalise the whistleblower, all under cover of ?national security? or ?stability? of government or ?official secrecy?, is an attack on the freedom of expression and the people?s right to know. What falls under the Official Secrets Act in a democracy is something that needs constant contest, the need for official secrecy has to be weighed against the citizen?s right to know. For, the same statute book that has the OSA gives pride of place to the Act that empowers citizens to access, and to demand, information under the control of public authorities in order to promote transparency. In any conflict between the two, in a democracy that calls itself open, surely the letter ? and spirit ? of the right to freedom of speech and expression and information should trump the archaic and increasingly anachronistic OSA. Notably, the Supreme Court has recognised this democratic imperative. Over the years, India?s apex court has enlivened and expanded the protections accorded to the whistleblower, to ensure that those who expose corruption and wrongdoing are not vulnerable to bullying and intimidation.

If AG Venugopal?s objection in court on Wednesday were to be taken seriously, if it were to be dignified by the court, it could be a chilling message that would strike at the heart of a free press. It would protect the wrongdoers in the dark. The court must, as it has in the past, uphold the way of the open democracy.",Stealing the facts,The Indian Express,
34,Rafale Deal,"The Supreme Court has prodded the Centre again on the controversial Rafale fighter purchase terms. Earlier court directions had to do with the selection process, but more searching questions are now being asked, mainly on two issues: pricing and the offset deal between Dassault and an Indian private player. The government might take cover under the Officials Secrets Act on not disclosing the pricing of a deal already being fulfilled by India with the first payment made to Dassault. It would, however, be in everyone?s interest for the Centre to be more forthcoming on the deal than it has been ? in Parliament and in the Supreme Court. Perhaps it?s too late to take the major Opposition leaders into confidence on the deal?s broader aspects.

There?s never been any doubt on the Rafale?s quality and weapon capabilities. But public money is being spent and questions will be asked. It?s up to the government to satisfy those who want to know more about the new deal, after the deal envisaged by the UPA government was altered. Also, India has a right to know if a bribe or unfair commission was built into the deal as a not so well-equipped private player, with little previous history of defence manufacturing, is among many with offset deals that will see money ploughed back into making parts and subsidiary systems in India. While disclosures may be a concern over the nature of tactical weaponry being revealed if the pricing details were to be made public, there is little need not to be forthcoming on the offset deals if suspicions are to be cleared.",Rafale deal: Come clean,Deccan Chronicle,
35,Rafale Deal,"Win-win deal for India-France collaboration

Almost a year after Prime Minister Narenda Modi announced India would purchase 36 ready-to-use Rafale fighter planes from France, India and France have inked an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) to formalise the announcement. This is the first fighter aircraft deal India has finalised since the 1990s, when the Russian Sukhois were purchased. While it paves the way to add teeth to the Indian Air Force, which is battling a shortage of fighter squadrons, the deal also strengthens bilateral cooperation between the two countries in defence matters straddling the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. India is already heavily invested with France in military equipment, including the Scorpene submarines which have come under a cloud after critical data was leaked to a foreign publication. While investigations are on regarding the breach, the incident is unlikely to impact India-France ties. The Indian Navy was quick to say that Project

75-I, of which the Scorpene class submarine is a part, will proceed once a strategic partnership model is put in place. There had been two major concerns critics of the Rafale deal had flagged. The first related to the high cost, both hidden and open. And the second was about the very capability of the fighter jet manufactured by Dassault Aviation. Tough bargaining over the last year from the Indian side and the French Government's willingness to accommodate New Delhi's viewpoint, have resulted in a saving of nearly 750 million euros for India, when compared to the arrangement that had been worked by the previous UPA regime. The aircraft deal is now worth 7.87 billion euros. Additionally, there is a 50 per cent offset clause that mandates the French company to invest half the contracted amount in India. This will create employment opportunities at home and add to skill development. There is also a penalty clause that India can invoke in case of Dassault's failure to meet stipulated obligations. The cost would have been even lower than the roughly Rs 1,640 crore per aircraft, but for India's insistence on tweaking the specifications to meet its needs ? such as the ?cold start' system for the plane to operate efficiently at high altitude. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar's earlier remark that he was a ?tough negotiator? was not, after all, an empty boast.

As regards Rafale's cutting-edge capabilities, there was never any doubt, though some experts, while making comparisons with similar Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), believed otherwise. The Rafale is ahead of the F-16 planes being used in various parts of the world and is comparable to the American fifth-generation F-35. Besides, it's way ahead of the Su-30 that India has as its answer to the F-16. It can perform air defence and ground attacks simultaneously, with a combat range of 780 km to 1,500 km; carry more than nine tones of weapons, including nuclear arsenal; and use its precision-guided missile systems to hit targets at a range of 300 km. 

It may be a coincidence, but the agreement comes at a time of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan and China's insistence on backing this sponsor of terror. It always helps to fortify one's defence capabilities when one has a hostile neighbour on the one hand and a slippery one, on the other.",The Rafale advantage,The Pioneer,
36,Rafale Deal,"There?s no such thing as a benign Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report. The government?s auditor is expected to be finicky and puritanical when it comes to processes and finances ? and it is usually that. The report by CAG on the Indian Air Force?s acquisitions that was tabled in Parliament on February 13, is just that, although not in a way that either the government or the opposition would want. The report is on 11 air force purchases, although much of the focus has been on one deal ? the purchase of 36 Rafale fighters through an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) between India and France.

At one level, the report on Rafale, is a vindication of the government?s stance that it bought the aircraft at a lower price than in an older deal negotiated by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), and scrapped in March 2015. At another, by highlighting the absence, in the new deal, of financial and performance guarantees on around 25% of the cost of the old deal, the government?s auditor has explicitly articulated its point of view that Rafale maker Dassault Aviation has saved some amount of money and not passed it on to the government of India. This, the fact that the offsets part of the deal will only be dealt with in a subsequent report, and the report?s mere restatement of the government?s position on the lack of financial and performance guarantees in the new deal will likely provide enough material for the Congress and other parties to continue to ask questions about the deal. The big message in the CAG report, though, isn?t any of this. Anyone reading the report cannot but be appalled at the way the defence procurement process works in India. It is, at best, inefficient, and at worst, opaque.

Sample this: the government spent four years, between 2000, when it first set out to buy the much-needed fighter jets, and 2004, deciding whether the purchase should be done on a so-called single-source basis or through a competitive bid. The government in charge was the first edition of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Or this: in November 2004, having decided to opt for the competitive bidding route, the government put out a Request for Interest. The CAG report says the only thing this contributed to the process was a delay. Sure enough, the Request for Quotations didn?t go out till August 2007. The government of the day? The first edition of the UPA. The bureaucracy and the defence establishment seem to have done their bit too. The CAG report is especially harsh on the narrow definition of Air Staff Qualitative Standards or ASQRs, and the arrival of the benchmark price, which seems to be without basis ? a committee under UPA-1 came up with a price 47% lower than the lowest bid in the case of the old deal; the Indian negotiation team for the IGA under the NDA, started with one that was 57% lower. The CAG terms both prices unrealistic.

In what must cause discomfort to the UPA, the report says Dassault was treated preferentially in the old deal. Indeed, the fighter didn?t meet nine of the ASQRs; the company was allowed to change its technology and price bid. CAG also says a competing bid from the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) was also non-compliant. Interestingly, after the deal was all but done, in June 2012, the then defence minister asked for an overview of the entire process. By the time this overview was complete, the government had changed. This overview, results of which were submitted in March 2015, found bids of both Dassault and EADS non-compliant and recommended that the process be restarted.

And so, 15 years after the process began, India found itself at the starting point again. A reading of the CAG report shows that this isn?t unique to the fighter deal. It mentions a 2012 acquisition of 11 Doppler Radars by the Air Force, which took 96 months, and points out that the India Meteorological Department, also a government department, took a mere 11 months to acquire the same equipment. Irrespective of what their positions may be on the Rafale deal, the government and the opposition need to agree that the defence acquisition process needs an overhaul. The new government (whichever one) that takes over in May would do well to set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee to do this.",CAG report on Rafale highlights the flawed process,The Hindustan Times,
37,Rafale Deal,"When an institution that believes in hi-tech surveillance of ordinary citizens fails to prevent some of its most precious documents from being stolen, it is the stuff of pure comedy. Only when that institution is the government of a country, it is no longer comic but dangerous. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre has declared that crucial documents relating to the Rafale deal have been stolen. The dangers this implies are multiple. The disconnect is dizzying: while the ministry of home affairs empowers Central agencies to snoop on citizens? computers to stop crime and terrorism, the defence ministry is blind to the thieves in its midst. While the BJP?s minions seize ?anti-nationals? and mobs kill people from minority groups in the name of cow protection while beating up Kashmiris on the side, a targeted little burglary is executed in the building that houses the defence and foreign ministries and the Prime Minister?s Office. This argues incompetence of such gigantic proportions that comedy vanishes. It must have been this incompetence that allowed a private vehicle loaded with explosives to destroy a truck full of jawans amid a military convoy on a highly protected route. It is the same incompetence, this time in propaganda, that has ministers and officials scrambling to reach an agreement on the number of dead militants in Balakot.

There is, shamefully enough, another side to the government?s declaration. The allegedly stolen papers were used by a newspaper to expose dubious aspects of the Rafale deal. The government appears unable to conceal its anxiety that these documents might be used as evidence in court. Perhaps it hopes that if they have been stolen ? a charge not made when the newspaper used them ? their ?unclean? source may discredit them as evidence. To distract attention from a mess that is obviously far from simple, the government, through its mouthpiece in court, is talking of the newspaper?s supposed violation of the Official Secrets Act. Wielding laws is the easy way out. More dangerous, however, is the Narendra Modi-led government?s attitude towards journalism. Independent thinking, analysis, criticism and pursuit of truth for public interest are simply impermissible.

38,Hathras Rape Case,"The Yogi regime is trying to stigmatise legitimate outcry on the Hathras murder
The registration of multiple police cases in Uttar Pradesh on charges of conspiracy and sedition is an insensitive, albeit unsurprising, response to the legitimate outrage sparked by the way in which its officials had handled the aftermath of the gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl in Hathras. The State administration is seeking to convert the outcry and political advocacy into a putative conspiracy to foment caste discord. There seems to be inadequate recognition that initial attempts to deny that any rape took place and to prevent political leaders and the media from meeting the girl?s family pointed to an administrative posture hostile to the doing of complete justice. It was only to be expected that such an attitude would create a backlash against the State government. The only way to restore its image is to display empathy for the victim and treat protests seeking justice as legitimate. Even though the suspects named by the 19-year-old before her death in a Delhi hospital have been arrested and the FIR includes the charge of gang rape, there are clear signs that the Yogi Adityanath government is adopting dubious tactics to prevent what it sees as the crystallisation of public opinion against itself. Recognising that the formation of an SIT did not help undo the damage to the government?s image, the Chief Minister recommended a CBI investigation. However, even that came across as a move to fob off any adverse order from the Allahabad High Court, which has taken suo motu cognisance of the matter.

Remarks by senior police officers to the effect that there was no evidence of rape ? citing the absence of semen in swabs taken for forensic analysis ? indicated an official reluctance to acknowledge the gang-rape part of the offence. Latest reports suggest that a journalist on his way to Hathras and three others have been detained. They are also sought to be linked to the Popular Front of India, an organisation whose name came up in connection with recent riots and anti-government protests. This raises the suspicion of an attempt to control the narrative by resorting to a template of identifying members of a communal organisation as alleged conspirators and instigators of violence. The template includes the use of penal provisions relating to sedition and conspiracy and the projection of a theory that all protests and political activity against it constitute a plot to overthrow the government. A responsive government would have endeavoured to extend a healing touch, reassure the victims, and reserve its wrath for the offenders. Instead, the Adityanath government is focusing on blaming political leaders, pressuring the victim?s family and preventing the emergence of a united voice against sexual violence, attacks on the marginalised communities and the devastating effect an unregenerate caste hierarchy has on society.",Grapes of wrath: On Yogi Adityanath regime handling Hathras case,The Hindu,

Police hurriedly set the pyre alight under cover of night, without allowing the family to properly mourn their dear one or conduct customary last rites.

Now an entire district is under Section 144 CrPC to quell protests and prevent politicians from meeting the family. A police cordon ran around the village to keep the family out of the media. A viral video of Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar talking down to the Dalit family, warning of harm to their credibility, is in fact a body blow to the government?s credibility. It lends credence to the family?s claims of threats from the administration.

The victim?s mother purportedly found her brutalised body without clothes on. A professional police force would have proceeded to verify rape. But analysis of samples happened 11 days after hospitalisation and no semen was detected. Government?s own guidelines rule out the likelihood of finding such evidence after 72-96 hours of rape. This helps the police and accused build a case for undermining the gangrape charge despite the victim?s dying declaration. With rank incompetence and apathy to answer for, officials are taking cover under threat to public order. Throttling dissent in this manner isn?t going to help. BJP must remember that the Nirbhaya case punctured UPA-2 and Sheila Dikshit. No civilised society can tolerate in silence and without protest the brutalisation inflicted on the 19-year-old, the botched investigation or the indignities heaped upon the hapless Dalit family. The Adityanath government must correct policing failures for people?s as well as its own sake.",Dalit Nirbhaya: The state?s apathy just keeps getting worse,The times of India,
40,Hathras Rape Case,"All states have information departments to put out the official line on any given subject. But in ?atmanirbhar? Uttar Pradesh has the government felt the need to hire the services of a PR firm to press its controversial claim that the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was gang-raped last month in Hathras and succumbed to her injuries on September 29 was not actually raped at all.

On Thursday night, a number of foreign correspondents in India ? and some national media correspondents ? received a ?clarification note? from Concept PR, a Mumbai-based public relations firm with the ungrammatic headline:

?Hathras girl was not rape, reveal Forensic investigation, Preliminary Medical and Post-mortem report?

The note played up other claims too, such as:

?The reports also revealed the conspiracy to push the state into caste turmoil?


?SIT is sure to unveil evil design behind the whole incident?

Prasar Bharati Cuts Ties With PTI, Says it Will Invite Bids from 'Domestic News Agencies'
And in a presumed reference to the government?s decision to quickly cremate the victim?s body in the middle of the night against the wishes of her family, the note says:

Police action was prompt to prevent untoward incident: further intensive probe into the matter

The PR note then goes on to reiterate what the UP assistant director general (ADG) of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar had already told the Indian media:

?Putting to rest all the speculation, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report on the vaginal sample of the 19-year-old girl of Hathras has revealed that she was not raped. This is the conclusive confirmatory report after the post mortem medical report and post mortem report both have concluded that no rape was committed.?

While the UP government?s claim that the ?Hatras girl was not rape(d)? has been questioned by medical and legal experts who say the state?s police evidently do not understand the definition of rape in the Indian Penal Code or the basics of rape forensics, the PR note makes it clear that the ongoing investigation is going to focus less on the Hathras crime and its perpetrators and more on the alleged ?conspiracy to push the state into caste turmoil? which the ADG says the forensic report had ?exposed?.

The ?clarification note? also specifies that the Special Investigation Team assigned by chief minister Adityanath to look into the matter ?is sure to unveil evil designs of vested interests who wanted to create an atmosphere of disharmony in Uttar Pradesh.?

The UP Police will ?now probe as to who was responsible for this malafide campaign and twisted the facts despite the statements of the responsible officers otherwise?.

This particular mention in the press note should be read as a warning to domestic media houses which have reported the Hathras incident as a gang-rape, quoting the family, or would still follow up on the story as so ? besides sending out a caution to foreign correspondents to stay away from it.

The wider message also appears to be that in ?New India? rapes don?t take place, certainly none that reflect the harsh reality of caste injustices. And that any global attention on this case ? akin to the Nirbhaya rape case of 2012 when the Congress-led UPA was in power ? will not be acceptable. If anything, global media coverage would likely be looked upon by the government as part of a ?conspiracy?, an ?evil design? against UP and india.

This PR move was likely prompted by the fact that the rape victim?s death hit the headlines in several international papers, including the New York Times and the Guardian. The Adityanath government urgently needed a media strategy to nip this coverage in the bud, and also give some ammunition to the BJP?s NRI supporters to defend the party on social media and elsewhere.",Yogi Govt Enlists PR Firm to Push ?Hathras Girl Was Not Raped? Story Line With Foreign Media,The Wire,
41,Hathras Rape Case,"What makes a powerful government so insecure that it must build a wall of policemen to barricade from public view ? and cut off access to ? a village in which a traumatised Dalit family grieves the death of a 19-year-old daughter brutalised by upper caste men? That question is answered in the heavy-handedness of the Uttar Pradesh government of Yogi Adityanath as it clumsily tries to brush, under countless carpets, its callousness and ineptitude. The crime in Hathras was heinous. But what has followed in its wake, the hurried cremation by the police in the dark, the denial of the family?s right to perform the last rites, followed by boorish police action to prevent anyone, including Opposition leaders of the Congress and TMC, from reaching the young woman?s family, has added up to a sordid spectacle that should deeply embarrass the Yogi Adityanath regime in UP. Reassuringly, the court has stepped in to restore a semblance of civility, uphold the law. Taking suo motu cognisance of incidents that have ?shocked our conscience?, and calling it a matter of ?immense public importance and public interest?, the Allahabad High Court has promised to look into allegations of ?violation of the basic human and fundamental rights not only of the deceased victim but also of her family members?.

It remains to be seen if the court?s rightful outrage, and mounting public indignation, are successful in making a dent in a wider culture of impunity that appears to be deepening in UP. The police?s grave missteps in Hathras have been preceded by a series of warning signals. The number of encounters grows in the state ? 115 at last count ? even as there is no action against any policeman for the extrajudicial killings. They receive political sanction, in fact, from the ruling party. Two police officials have been chargesheeted in the Vikas Dubey case ? featuring the gangster in whose rise and death the police evidently played a dubious role. Three police officials stand chargesheeted by the CBI in the Unnao rape case of 2017. The lines between those whose responsibility it is to uphold the law and those who break it have been blurring dangerously in UP. Here, the police routinely invites allegations of conducting itself as an arm of the ruling party, not the state. And of standing with the powerful and targeting the vulnerable who most need protection of the law ? those who belong to a lower caste or class, a minority religion, or take a dissenting political position.

The Hathras case is a test for the UP Police, and also for the Yogi Adityanath government that it reports to. All of the government?s determined efforts to project and promote UP as a well governed state will amount to naught if it is unable to send out a simple message ? that it is fully committed to upholding the law and bringing to book those who think they can brutalise a woman and get away with it.","Barricading the village of a grieving family shows how insecure the UP government is, and how compromised its police.",The Indian Express,
42,Hathras Rape Case,"On a day that governments and government servants are called upon to renew their commitment to peace and the nation?s progress, rising caste crimes and back-to-back rapes ? in Hathras, Bulandshahr, Azamgarh, Balarampur and now Bhadohi ? have together come as a terrible reflection on governance, law and order, and society.

Amid the resulting outrage and claims ? of police destroying evidence in Hathras and Balarampur in order to hasten the closure of the particular cases ? Smriti Irani?s praise at the UN of Indian laws as ?strong enablers? of women does not sound credible.

Save for the Prime Minister ? who issued a call in general terms for ?strict action? in the case ? there has not been a single statement from the home minister ? who is set to resume political work in poll-bound West Bengal ? or from any women leaders in the government.

When the erstwhile government, which returned to power in 2019, said Beti Bachao, it was perhaps not a slogan. It was a warning.

Following the controversial midnight cremation of the Hathras rape victim against the wishes of her family, the UP police is claiming that she had not been raped and that the matter is being ?twisted? to ?stir caste tension?.

Even while the specific nature of the offence remains moot following the stealthy cremation precluding a second autopsy, how does this glib desexualisation of the crime lessen its severity ? the victim had been permanently disabled ? or its essential egregiousness?

Also pertinently, how does this ? or theories of a dispute over cleaning a drain ? show that it is not a caste crime, rather than prove it otherwise?

A relative has reported being told by police that there was no monetary relief to be given to the family after the death of its prospective earning member who contributed valuable labour.

But should a caste atrocity be proved to have been committed on the girl, her kin are entitled to full compensation under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

This sly spin doctoring by police of the case thus only goes to lay bare their sexist mindset ? the fact that they did not value her life and its promise ? as well as their bad work ethic ? of staying on the right side of the local caste dynamic and protecting their jobs instead of serving the citizen.

New NCRB crime data reports 59,853 crimes against women from UP in 2019, the highest among states. This includes not only rapes, but also dowry deaths, crimes against a minor, domestic abuse and so on. Rights denials, which lie at the core and crux of all these offences, are no doubt outside the ambit of this classification.

However, rape also being a caste crime, data shows that nine states in India, including Uttar Pradesh, accounted for 84 per cent of all crimes against dalits the same year; yet the conviction rate of offences under the Atrocities Act was only 32 per cent, with the pendency rate an alarming 94 per cent. Hate crimes against dalits went up by seven per cent in 2019.

The ruling party at the Centre and the state has accused the Opposition of playing politics in Hathras.

But what else is the Opposition supposed to do in the face of such blatant condoning of criminality as we witness in case after case?

Nevertheless, as members of the victim?s family continue to remain in effective house arrest, the borders of Hathras district have been sealed, Section 144 of the CrPC imposed for a month, and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi detained and roughed up by police on their way to the victim?s home.

Taking suo motu cognisance of the case, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court issued notices to the Uttar Pradesh government.

43,Hathras Rape Case,"Dalit girl from Hathras dies after being brutally gang-raped. Where are the deterrent laws and action? Will we have to wait years again?

The ?Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao? campaign is being slandered with each passing day as it becomes a ?Beti Hatao, Beti Darao? mission in reality, with heinous crimes against the girl child and women going up every day across the country. So it is that just two days after Daughter?s Day, a 19-year-old Dalit girl was brutally gang-raped in Uttar Pradesh?s Hathras district. In a chilling throwback to the Nirbhaya case and the incident in Hyderabad not so long ago, the girl was left with her tongue cut out, ostensibly to prevent her from testifying. Her legs were bruised so severely and her spine was so lethally battered that she was completely paralysed while her arms could just about register a movement. Still she fought for her dear life over 15 days in hospital but gave up despite being brought to Delhi?s AIIMS. Yet there was no outcry for the last fortnight till she became just another cold statistic. Nobody mourned a young life snuffed out in its prime due to caste-based hatred, sexual depravity and a deteriorating law and order situation, particularly in the Hindi heartland. Exacerbating the situation, as usual, were the poorly conducted investigations and a slow justice system. The conviction rate for rape is only 27.2 per cent despite the fact that it accounts for 11.5 per cent of the total crime statistics. On an average, 91 rapes were reported every single day across India in 2018, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. The Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) says that trial in rape cases should be completed in 60 days but that never happens because of the tardiness of police investigations. Then there are judicial flaws that need to be plugged when it comes to rape, the primary being bail to the accused, which should be denied till the probe is completed. Some independent studies indicate that the average time of finishing trial even in fast track courts is eight months. And even if one were to get death penalty, acquittals, appeals and mercy petitions mean that only about five per cent death penalties are actually upheld by the Supreme Court. A traumatised rape survivor hardly has the courage to go through such travesty and gives up midway. The 2012 Nirbhaya rape, which shook the conscience of not just the nation but the world, too, compelled our parliamentarians to strengthen the punitive justice delivery system based on the recommendations of a committee that included eminent jurists. It led to some crucial amendments to the law, which included changing the very definition of ?rape?, the establishment of fast-track courts to ensure victims get justice without undue delay, harsher punishments for the accused with the provision of death sentence being added to it and the abolition of the two-finger test among others. Two other such incidents, in Kathua and Unnao, where two children were raped, had widened the scope of punishment for raping a child under 12 to death penalty. Undoubtedly, there has been an increase in reportage of crimes against women after Nirbhaya though much of them are still under-reported. Besides, as the Hyderabad incident has shown, question marks remain on the use of the death penalty as criminals are now murdering their victims to destroy evidence. For the criminal, there is no deterrent. But yes, he can be stalled if deterrence is built into the system by fast-tracking procedures and ensuring swift justice. Conviction rates need to go up proportionately. At present, fast-track courts are no different from the usual courts in terms of case pile-ups and vacancies. A quick, fair and unbiased judicial set-up with requisite number of judges is a sine qua non. A continuously responsive system is a bigger deterrent than one or two landmark rulings.

The unchecked crimes against women and the girl child are also skewering gender equity in the rural hinterland. According to a study supported by the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), that was conducted in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the increasing crimes against women have deepened preferences for a son. So much so that we have lost around 4,60,000 girls to sex selection at birth each year between 2013 and 2017, according to the UNFPA. When errants go scot-free and the woman?s family is left to wallow in pain and shame, a malaise becomes a societal archetype. And the girl child will continue to be vulnerable, either used as a tool in a caste war as the rapists in Hathras belonged to the upper caste, a sacrifice in a revenge drama or a family feud or a life cheap enough to be pawned by male-dominated codes. Predictably, there is a political slugfest over this latest incident, with the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) slamming the BJP Government in UP for the sorry plight of law and order in the State. Their protests will once again be tainted by the ruling party as ?crocodile tears? and a ?political conspiracy? to ?defame the Government.? The Opposition will predictably make the rape a subset of excesses on Dalits. But neither the Opposition nor the ruling party was there for the girl when she was writhing in hospital for a fortnight. And much to the shame of India?s most populous State, nobody wants to roll back UP?s unique distinction of reporting the highest crime spiral against women. As for justice, will we have to wait another seven years?",Another silent Nirbhaya,The Pioneer,
44,Hathras Rape Case,"There is now a growing opinion ? including among some in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ? that the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has handled the Hathras case poorly. This could be due to political patronage to members of a caste group deemed loyal; it could be due to administrative incompetence; it could be due to the patriarchal mindset that governs both social and institutional attitudes towards women; it could be due to the prejudice with which Dalits are viewed in this country; or it could be due to all these factors.

What the UP government needed to do was ensure correctives ? both in the immediate context to hold perpetrators as well as administrative officials in Hathras accountable and in the medium-term by instituting structural reforms in the criminal justice system and its intersection with political power.

Instead, it has decided to order a probe into an ?international? conspiracy and plot to defame the Yogi Adityanath government and foment caste violence. The UP police has also filed 19 FIRs against both named and unnamed individuals on charges ranging from sedition to promoting enmity between castes and communities. This is outrageous. The outcry against the injustice in Hathras was because citizens were shaken and angry and wanted action. Not only did the UP government fail in its task of protecting the life, liberty and dignity of a young Dalit woman, it first sought to cover up the incident and is now using the controversy to attack critics and construct conspiracy theories, invoking the proverbial foreign hand. The state should stop looking outside, and look within its own administration. That is where the fault lies.","Hathras: UP is on the wrong track, again",The Hindustan Times,
45,Hathras Rape Case,"Anti-national? elements, funded by foreigners, and the Opposition are going all out to hurt the image of the Yogi Adityanath government supposedly reputed for its excellent law and order
There it is ? the ?foreign hand?. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister has ordered an investigation into what he says is an international plot by groups and individuals overseas to create caste-based conflict in his state. This is the most imaginative defence to have been thought up to discredit the countrywide protests against administrative and police actions to suppress the realities of the alleged gang rape of a Dalit girl in Hathras by upper-caste men and her subsequent death. International conspiracy is an idea for a possible chorus that can be taken up by the Bharatiya Janata Party cadre and repeated ad nauseam in the hope that it can replace facts. Simultaneously, first information reports against protesters and an online site carrying information about protests are being lodged, on charges ranging from sedition and inciting conflict between groups to forgery and cheating as well as unlawful assembly, with arrests in some instances. Evidently, ?anti-national? elements, funded by foreigners, and the Opposition are going all out to hurt the image of the Yogi Adityanath government supposedly reputed for its excellent law and order. That is, the protests are contrived and motivated.

Apart from alleged efforts of the authorities to undermine the accusation of rape and the veracity of the family?s accounts, blocking Opposition leaders and members of the media from reaching the girl?s village, too, continued for days. But this showed up the rather low-key responses of the chiefs of the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party to the violence and the attempts to suppress what is being seen as a lethal upper-caste atrocity on a Dalit girl. Although Mayawati heads a Dalit-based party, all she could say was that the UP government should concentrate on ensuring justice for the Dalit family and could rectify its mistake, while rebuking the government for its silence after the family complained of threats by the district magistrate. The former firebrand leader of the party for social justice, Mulayam Singh Yadav, was silent; his son and present leader, Akhilesh Yadav, condemned the erasure of evidence by the cremation of the girl by the police and criticized the government for stopping his party workers from reaching the village. Since both leaders are on their own turf in the state, this is both disheartening and politically enigmatic.",Twisted plot: Conspiracy and the Hathras case,The Telegraph,
46,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"As the Ram temple gets under way, India must put the past of a communal struggle behind
The bhoomi pujan or the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of a grand temple for Lord Sri Ram in Ayodhya on Wednesday marks an end and a beginning. What it ends and what it begins can both be interpreted in different ways; how India collectively makes meaning out of it will define the future of the country hereon. One view is that the rising Ram temple signifies the end of perceived humiliation of the Hindus and the beginning of a new phase of their political ascendancy; the other is that it denotes the end of strife that shackled India?s potential for decades and heralds a new dawn of fraternity among religious communities. The end and the beginning, therefore, are not just open to interpretation, they hold the possibilities of change. For those who yearned for a temple at the site which they believe is the exact spot of Sri Ram?s birth, the journey so far has been tumultuous and violent. A Muslim place of worship that stood there for 464 years was demolished in 1992 to make way for the temple ? a serious crime according to the Supreme Court order last year that handed over the site to the Hindus. The proponents of the temple must consider this an occasion to seek conciliation over conquest, dialogue over diatribe, and tranquility over triumphalism.
 
The ceremony itself manifested multiple possibilities for the country?s future. In symbolism and rhetoric, the line of separation between state and religion was ominously crossed, notably by the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in it. In his speech, however, he cited Lord Ram?s adherence to justice, fairness and empathy for the vulnerable. He emphasised the importance of these values for the present. But while outlining a road map for an inclusive future, his interpretation of the past echoed familiar tropes of sectarian politics. Relitigating historical wrongs has rarely been the foundation for a harmonious and prosperous future. In India?s case, many of them are an outcome of its unpleasant encounter with British colonialism. Recent path-breaking studies in genetics have unearthed India?s past of being a melting pot of populations and cultures over millennia. India must put the acrimonious political mobilisations over religious issues behind it, and look forward to modern, secular governance. The construction of the temple is the logical result of the Supreme Court judgment; it should mark the end of an older, bitter phase of India, and the beginning of a new, harmonious phase.",Groundbreaking: On Ram temple bhoomi pujan,The Hindu,
47,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"Once again as a nation we seem to be living up to our reputation of creating a controversy on an issue that in reality should be an occasion of pride for the whole nation. After nearly five centuries aspirations of all Indians, who believe in India, are about to be realized in the form of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. Lord Ram is not only a religious deity for Hindus but also part of Indian heritage and therefore it is appropriate to say ?All Indians? instead of just limiting it to Hindus.

There was a lot of skepticism before the Supreme Court gave its verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute in November 2019. To the credit of Muslim litigants and the community as a whole, they accepted the verdict with grace and humility, a few disgruntled voices notwithstanding. This was particularly true for Hindu and Muslim communities in Ayodhya where everyone seemed to be relieved that a verdict had been reached.  They have lived there in harmony for ages and continue to do so today also when the construction of Ram Mandir is expected to start on 05 August with a simple ceremony. Both communities in Ayodhya have pledged to work towards building the temple and it is indeed a very welcome step as it also means development and prosperity for all. 

But then there are some on our country who cannot digest this simple truth. For them it is a taboo to see Hindus and Muslims standing shoulder to shoulder. Therefore, they have to create a controversy and ensure that Hindu Muslim divide raises its ugly head and vitiates the environment. The sad part is that most of these people are neither local residents of Ayodhya nor directly concerned in any manner with temple construction. Some political leaders from the opposition, a few pseudo seculars and some Muslim community leaders have jumped in the fray to question the building of the temple for various reasons. Needless to say, none of the reasons expounded by them stand to any scrutiny or have any merit. 

Some are now casting aspersions on the retired Chief Justice of India (CJI) under whose tenure the verdict was delivered while conveniently forgetting that it was a five-judge bench that delivered the judgment where CJI was just another member. One of the most senior politicians in the country wonders if building of the temple will help the nation in its fight against coronavirus? A question that frankly does not even warrant a response as it just shows a biased mindset and a deliberate lack of understanding of what Lord Ram means and stands for in this country. 

The biggest issue that seems to be bothering this anti-Mandir lobby is the decision by Door Darshan to telecast the ?Bhoomi Pujan? ceremony live. They think this move is against the secular credentials of the country, against the charter of the national broadcaster and has political connotations as BJP wishes to reach out for Hindu votes through this live broadcast. The same lobby had no problem when the visit of Pope or canonization of Mother Teresa or Haj pilgrimage bulletins were telecast live in the past apart from many other religious events for people of different faiths. For the lobby, those telecasts were within the realms of a secular India as they pertained to minority communities. But live telecast of Ram Mandir ?Bhoomi Pujan? event that has a much larger audience and significance is anti-secular. 

Without a doubt this is in line with the distorted version of secularism that has been practiced in the country for nearly seven decades where anything to do with Hindu or Hinduism is anti-secular. For any right-thinking Indian, irrespective of his religion, Ayodhya event has to be seen as a national event that is linked to nation?s heritage first and foremost. Any linkage to Hindu religion comes later. If any Indian cannot accept this axiomatic truth then his being a true Indian itself will be questionable. 

There has been a lot of debate on the participation of Prime Minister in the event in Ayodhya on 05 August. It is nothing but a ploy by Modi baiters to deride the Prime Minister. For many of them it is their only vocation since Mr Modi assumed the highest elected office in the country in 2014. Are Prime Ministers not allowed to have their beliefs as individuals? Nowhere dose the Indian constitution say that such leaders cannot practice their religion. Is it possible to believe that none of India?s past Presidents, Vice Presidents or Prime Ministers ever visited a religious place of worship? Ayodhya event is a once in a life time event for the nation. Attendance of the Prime Minister, who is holder of the highest elected office in the country, is warranted in his capacity as the NUMBER ONE representative of the people. 

Some have questioned the wisdom of holding ?Bhoomi Pujan? when the nation is going through the current Corona pandemic. Suffice it to say that all safeguards will be in place and all preventive measures taken as required. There are some who have put forth an argument that if this event can be allowed why not allow Id celebrations that are around the corner. This is again a very motivated argument aimed at creating mistrust and to stroke communal tensions. The festival of Id comes every year unlike the Ayodhya event which is a one-time event that the nation has been waiting for five centuries. Next, a festival like Id will mean thousands of congregations across the country unlike the Ayodhya event which is restricted to one place. It is obvious that while a single national event can be organized in a controlled manner with all precautionary measures in place, it will be impossible to exercise similar control over thousands of localized and uncontrolled Id events across the country. A similar logic would be applicable to Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja and Diwali events this year if the pandemic threat continues to loom over the nation. 

It has to be understood that ?Bhoomi Pujan? for Ram Temple is not a political event. But given the opposition?s opposition to the event, there is a danger of it being seen as one. If that happens the onus will be on the opposition and not the government of the day. If there is any indirect political fallout from the event in favour of Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) then there is very little the opposition can do about it. However, by opposing it and coming out with lop sided statements and baseless reasons on why it should not be held, the opposition is only ensuring political gains for BJP. Frankly a mature opposition should have seen the writing on the wall and supported the event. That would have resulted in a favorable political fallout for them many times more than what BJP may get today. But then current Indian political opposition and maturity were divorced five years ago and a remarriage is nowhere on the cards given the quality of their leaders",The Ram temple ?bhoomi pujan? controversy,The times of India,
48,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"Notwithstanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s impressive address in Ayodhya to build an inclusive India based on the ideals of Ramrajya of social harmony, justice, piety, love and peace, the edifice of the Indian republic remains damaged.

By performing bhoomipujan for Ram Mandir, PM Modi junked his constitutional oath of office that makes it mandatory for him to ?discharge all duties faithfully and conscientiously? for the Union and ?do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will?.

The very act signals a resolve to replace constitutional virtues of justice, secularism, equality and fraternity with equivalent concepts acceptable to Hindu majoritarianism.

There is no parallel of such gross departure from the Constitution in the history of independent India.

Only two acts come close enough ? installation of Somnath temple after its renovation in May 1951 by President Rajendra Prasad and, Rajiv Gandhi?s approval to open Babri mosque?s locks (where idols were surreptitiously installed in 1949) in 1986.

The first act was strongly opposed by Jawaharlal Nehru. After cautioning his minister K.M. Munshi of the dangers of ?Hindu revivalism?, Nehru told Rajendra Babu, ?I confess I do not like the idea of you associating yourself with a spectacular opening of the Somnath temple. This is not merely visiting a temple? but rather participating in a significant function which unfortunately has a number of implications.?

Nehru's warning, not to mix religion with statecraft, proved prophetic.

The blunder by his grandson led to shilanayas of the temple in 1989 and a militant movement to release the idols from ?captivity?. It prompted L.K. Advani to launch Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 that culminated in demolishing Babri Mosque, thus, badly scarring the syncretic fabric of India.

Innumerable communal riots and rise of extremist Islam in the immediate aftermath bear a testimony of this folly.

Justice suffered a blow in November 2019 when the Supreme Court overturned Allahabad high court judgement and handed over the entire 2.77 acres of land to the deity despite no archaeological evidence to back such a claim.

 With this, it removed the final hinge holding the secular character of India to pave way for a de jure Hindu Rashtra.

Why the foundation ceremony in times of crises?

The answer lies in the word ? crises. The Hindutva forces chose August 5 precisely to smother the rising anger against the blunders the Modi government committed through draconian demonetisation, faulty GST, accosting crony capitalists at the expense of public exchequer and erroneous handling of Covid-19 pandemic.

Despite efforts to hide and manipulate data, the ground realities show the deep crises India has been sucked into.

PM Modi managed to hide poverty by constructing a wall around a shanty alongside President Trump?s route from Gandhinagar Airport to Motera stadium but walls cannot be built across India.
A rosy picture cannot be painted in the midst of a plunging economy when millions start marching to villages for fear of dying of hunger.

In such a scenario, any people-centric government would pull all stops to tackle the crises. But what a government would do whose sole concern is to win elections to forward its bigoted agenda?
It will do what it knows best, build a smokescreen to divert people?s attention from real issues and keep them on a high with a sense of purpose to win elections.

This is precisely what the Modi government has done despite the dangers of Covid-19 that is now growing fastest in India. The rest of the agenda has already been put to practice.

A web of pliant television channels and an army of social media trolls will try to keep the public discourse limited to Ram Mandir and PM Modi?s aura to help BJP win upcoming elections in states of Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.
The ultimate aim is to keep crises shrouded in this smokescreen until the inauguration of Ram Mandir in 2024 to ensure a dream run for a third straight win in Lok Sabha elections.

The onus to save Indian democracy now squarely lies upon Opposition parties and democratic, progressive liberal forces that lie scattered on the Indian political scene.

It has been made a wee bit more difficult by PM Modi?s smart move to change the narrative, from militant Hindutva to Ram?s inclusivity. Yet they can still do the impossible by getting together to pull down this smokescreen and help people see the reality that lies exposed everywhere.

By doing so they will do justice to the Maryadapurshottam who gave up his throne and embraced exile to help his father satisfy the whims of crafty stepmother, Kaikeyi. He is again being used to break the maryada of the Constitution to establish a New Republic by an equally crafty political party. Hey Ram!",Progressives must unite to expose government?s ?Ram? narrative,The Asian age,
49,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"In an unusual move that has left everyone bemused, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose to play an  all-encompassing role during the bhoomi pujan in Ayodhya on August 5. He was not only the chief guest but also the master of ceremonies and the official yajmaan (patron of a religious ritual) during the ceremony. 

In certain quarters, an analogy has been drawn between Modi?s participation in the Ayodhya mega event and the presence of India?s first President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, at the inaugural ceremony of the reconstructed Somnath temple in 1951. 

However, the two instances cannot be compared. Unlike Ayodhya, there was nothing divisive about the inaugural ceremony at Somnath, since it was not performed at a site that was disputed or mired in a long-standing, contentious legal battle. 

Conventionally, a prime minister would attend such an event as the chief guest, while the key rituals would be performed by a religious leader present on the occasion ? in  Ayodhya, it would be someone like Mahant Nritya Gopaldas, who is not only the head of the old Ramjanmbhoomi Nyas and the newly formed, government-constituted Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust  but also the senior-most seer in the temple town. He has had a long association with the Ram temple movement.

It is well known that Nritya Gopaldas was earlier sore about the fact that the formal ritual of transferring the deity of Ram ?Lalla? from the makeshift temple to an interim structure, to facilitate the new temple?s construction was carried out by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yogi Adityanath. He was pacified only after he was named president of the Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust.

The puja could also have been performed by one of the Shankaracharyas, but they were not present at the ceremony. As for the 140-odd religious figures who were present at the venue, they were there only as a token presence and had little to do with the puja.

It was Modi alone who played a larger-than-life role that day, as if displaying a sense of ownership of the event. That was the message conveyed to 130 crore Indians, to whom he made repeated references.

Meanwhile, with all the frontline leaders of the temple movement being kept away on the day of the bhoomi poojan, it was deafeningly clear that it was a Modi show all the way. Even the fact that, ultimately, a Supreme Court verdict had made the event possible, was relegated to the background. The man on the street seemed to be attributing the credit for the Ram temple to just one man ? ?Prime Minister Narendra Modi?.

Indeed, as far as the messaging was concerned, nothing was left to chance. Some of the key BJP leaders who had spearheaded the temple movement in its early days ? and are now facing trial in the Babri Masjid demolition case ? were not extended invitations for the ceremony.  

On the face of it, the invitations had been issued by the new 15-member Trust ? after all, the prime minister also  said, ?I am grateful to the Trust for inviting me here? ? but the Trust itself, which has also been entrusted with the task of temple construction, was constituted by the Union government! 

Moreover, none other than Nripendra Misra, former IAS officer who was PM Modi?s most-trusted bureaucrat as his principal secretary, is the Trust?s chief executive. How the guest list must have been drawn up is fairly obvious.  

It may be convenient to cite the pandemic as a valid enough reason to keep the ?oldies? at a ?safe? distance. But there are many within the party fold who are wondering if it may not have been more appropriate to extend an invitation to former party stalwarts like Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi or Kalyan Singh and left it to them to decide.  

Other than UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, it was the RSS chief, Mohan Bhagwat, who was accorded some significance. He not only addressed the gathering but also went to the extent of prompting the priest to speed up the proceedings.

That was not all. No religious leader from Ayodhya was included among the nine priests who carried out the puja, led by Acharya Gangadhar Pathak. He was handpicked by the organisers from Vrindavan, where he is not counted among the important religious leaders.  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with UP Governor Anandiben Patel, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and others perform Bhoomi Pujan rituals for the construction of the Ram Mandir, at Ayodhya on August 5. Photo: PTI

While Acharya Pathak and three others were seated near the place where the ritual was being conducted, four priests stood around as chaperons to assist in the ritual. Acharya Govind Dev Giri, from Pune, who is the treasurer of the Trust, was seated there throughout the ritual. 

Many wondered why a lesser known priest from a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) sponsored ashram like the Keshav Dham in Vrindavan was asked to carry out the puja at the high-profile event. As the event progressed, the mystery was solved. What was interesting ? and clearly visible ? was the fact that he was carrying a written script to conduct the 35-minute ritual! The benefit of having a relatively unknown priest lead the puja were evident, for he spent more time singing paeans to the prime minister than on the ritual.","At Ayodhya Bhoomi Pujan, Modi Became All-in-One; Proper Rituals Not Followed, Allege Pundits",The Wire,
50,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"August 5 is the culmination of movements that powered the BJP's idea of India, how it takes it forward is the test

India?s secularism has been a variant of the traditional western notion of the strict wall of separation between church and state.
August 5, when construction of the Ram temple began at Ayodhya ? one year after the abrogation of Article 370 by the BJP-led Centre in Kashmir ? marks a milestone for the BJP, and for India. For the BJP, it will have a tidy resonance. On August 5, it achieved its grand cause, which had energised its politics and powered several mobilisations for decades.

The issue that coalition politics compelled it to place on the ?backburner? in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime has now journeyed to the centre, flamboyant and triumphant, in Narendra Modi raj. Of the two large national political projects that reconfigured India?s politics in the early 1990s ? Mandal and Mandir ? the former met with only scattered and fragmented success while the BJP has led the latter to full and unequivocal fulfilment. But if the BJP has reason to celebrate a conclusion, for India, the beginning of temple construction at Ayodhya underlines a challenge. The leading role of the Prime Minister, Chief Minister and Governor at an event ostensibly organised by the Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust was foretold. Even so, its images, of intimacies between state and religion, have implications that will need to be grappled with in days and years to come.

India?s secularism has been a variant of the traditional western notion of the strict wall of separation between church and state. The Indian version has described itself, more, as being about a state that keeps equal distance from all religions but respects them all. Now, even that increasingly embattled idea of equi-distance will need to be qualified or redefined. Of course, this task is the burden of the non-BJP parties, should they have the stomach for it, which, so far, they don?t.

In the BJP?s narrative, on the other hand, a discredited secularism has deservedly fallen. At Ayodhya on Wednesday, Prime Minister Modi sought to draw parallels between the bhoomi pujan on August 5 and August 15, Independence Day. A five-centuries-old struggle had triumphed in the liberation of an idea that will now be the link, the PM said, between ?nar? and ?narayan? (man and god), ?lok? and ?aastha? (people and faith) ?vartman? and ?ateet? (past and present). The Ram temple, he said would be an inspiration for a self-confident and self-reliant India on the world stage.

The BJP?s political opponents may not rise to the challenge posed by the far-reaching changes in political culture wrought by it ? both the first anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 and the bricklaying for the temple at Ayodhya have been met by the same sullen silence, if not acquiescence. But as the ruling party at the Centre of a diverse nation, the BJP must be mindful of the dangers of majoritarian triumphalism. Even the Supreme Court, which paved the way for the temple by giving the disputed site to the Hindu side, described the 1992 destruction of the Babri masjid as illegal. The demolition case continues in court. At Ayodhya on Wednesday, there was no mention of the debris of the mosque that lies under the proposed temple, or of the exclusions of faith-based politics. These need to be acknowledged and addressed. Only then can the invocation of national unity ? by virtually the entire political establishment today ? ring sincere.",Brick and milestone,The Indian Express,
51,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"Nobody is stalling the Ram temple but the grand bhumi pujan in pandemic times raises uncomfortable questions

The timing, they say, is everything. So once the Supreme Court paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya, respecting civilisational belief and the heave of collective emotion and faith ? one that had been appropriated by politics ? one would have expected the exhibitionist propaganda around it to ebb away. Yet a grand bhumi pujan or foundation-laying ceremony is being planned during the nation?s worst time, in the middle of a pandemic, natural disasters and a stalled economy, if only to keep the temple agenda, and by extension those who live off it politically, alive. Everybody may be looking towards divine intercession in helpless times but does that behove the temple trust to host a grand ceremony, the expensive resources for which could be used for much-needed COVID-19 relief, or take liberties with social distancing rules as 250 guests, including 50 VIPs, are expected to attend a public gathering? The Government?s own advisory against public outings for those above 60 will be defeated as most guests, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and margdarshaks LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, are above that age limit. Question is whether these leaders will prize their religiosity over public service and messaging. Five silver bricks, symbolising the five planets as per Hindu mythology, will be used to lay the foundation, 11 priests from Varanasi and Ayodhya will congregate to do the rituals and to ward off evil spirits, silver figurines of a male and female snake and a tortoise will be buried at the construction site. Huge CCTV screens will dot Ayodhya for devotees to catch a glimpse of the proceedings, never mind if it encourages some kind of crowding. Granted, the ruling BJP has ridden a majoritarian wave to get its verdict and in the absence of a challenging Opposition, will ride the pandemic trough out, efficient or not. So it doesn?t need to mount another lavish showcase of its Hindu pride. Unless it wants to divert attention from its mishandling of the economy and burdening India?s migrant workforce. Agreed, it has to satisfy its core constituency of Hindu voters and ideologues but does that mean humouring them to such an extent that consciously privileges them and their rights over followers of other faiths and practices despite pandemic restrictions? And while world over prayers are on, wishing the end of COVID-19, how can the temple authorities justify that prayers during the ceremony on August 3 or August 5, being the most auspicious days, would help in ridding the country of the virus?

Of course, the political undertones are not too difficult to miss. The expected ceremony coincides with the first anniversary of the revocation of special status of the former State of Jammu & Kashmir and the abrogation of Article 370. While the Government may claim to have enacted that within a constitutional space and is already trotting out figures of developmental funding to justify the conversion of territories, the celebrations at Ayodhya say otherwise. They are meant to be a mid-term campaign of the Modi Government that it has fulfilled the promises made in its manifesto in record time. The event is also an indication that identity politics, which had been derailed by the pandemic, will gain momentum, examples of which are apparent from the way the Government is pursuing dissenters and activists even in the middle of a pandemic. Take the case of Varavara Rao, who was arrested in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case in 2018, which is now with the NIA. At 80, he is COVID-19 positive and was moved to a hospital much later. There is radio silence on his status with his family unaware of his condition. The Opposition criticism came from Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who said instead of a bhumi pujan now, the Government should focus on the pandemic and the economy. But the Modi Government, which has apportioned health management to respective States and knows that it could pass the buck in case of a worsening disease spiral to them, can hardly be expected to share Pawar?s concerns over Maharashtra, the worst-hit State. Congress leader Digvijaya Singh joined the chorus after Pawar made the move. But both leaders represent the ruling coalition in Maharashtra as partners of the Shiv Sena, which lauded the temple construction and claimed to have ?laid the road? to it, ?not for politics but out of faith.? The political fissures were all too apparent as Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray would attend and that the fight against the virus was being fought ?by our doctors in white attire, whom we call devdoot (messenger of God).? Question is whether Lord Ram himself would have condoned such celebrations or helped the sick instead. The problem is that there is no end to the temple card; it will continue to be used for historical corrections that are guided by narrow political considerations. Ayodhya?s god-king wouldn?t like his maryada to be tampered with. Yet, who cares?",Message or faith?,The Pioneer,
52,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"A legal dispute dating back to the late 19th century, a question of faith going back even longer, and a political issue that has shaped Indian politics for three decades were all addressed by the Supreme Court on Saturday, when it ruled on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue.

The court ruled in favour of a temple at Ayodhya, where many people believe Hindu God Ram was born, but also sought to address what it describes as a wrong committed against Muslims (especially during the 1992 demolition of a mosque that stood at the disputed site) by giving the Sunni Waqf Board five acres elsewhere in Ayodhya for a mosque.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has had the building of a Ram temple at Ayodhya as one of the fixtures in its manifesto, described the verdict as neither a victory nor a defeat, eschewing triumphalism, as indeed he has asked his colleagues to. Mohan Bhagwat, the supremo of the BJP?s ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has, directly, and through its affiliates, been at the forefront of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, echoed that sentiment.

While there?s been some talk (but no confirmation) of the Muslim parties seeking a review, most analysts are of the opinion that the court?s ruling marks the effective closure of the movement to build a temple. As such, it is a decision that has national, social, and political impact.

At the political level, the resolution of the temple issue means that 2019 has seen the end of both Mandal and mandir (temple) issues. The first refers to the 1990 implementation of the Mandal Commission?s report, reserving 27% of government jobs and college seats for Other Backward Classes. For at least three decades after that, the country?s political landscape was largely shaped by Mandal?s biggest beneficiaries. It was only the parliamentary elections of 2019 that finally seemed to put the ghost of Mandal to rest .

If Mandal gave India?s political landscape a clutch of parties that would dominate at least regional politics for three decades, the mandir movement gave it the BJP. The temple was the singular issue that helped revive the party?s fortunes after it slipped to two Lok Sabha seats in the 1984 parliamentary elections. Still, it was only after Narendra Modi and Amit Shah figured out a way to also consolidate the non-dominant OBC groupings that it really emerged the pole of Indian politics.
The verdict delivered by the Supreme Court is the beginning of the end of the mandir issue. Sure, its effects will be felt perhaps even in 2024 (it is likely that it will take a few years to build the temple, which is perfect timing for the next Lok Sabha polls), but not beyond. Which means 2019 has been a milestone year for the two significant political issues that have pretty much shaped Indian politics over the past three decades. It is the year one became irrelevant, and the other neared (if not achieved) closure.

At the national level, the overwhelming feeling seems to be one of relief. The movement to build a temple has had violent turns in the past, including the demolition of the mosque, and the nationwide riots that followed. India has many pressing issues and can?t afford to be held back by such conflicts. Much, though, will depend on whether the court?s decision encourages the RSS and its affiliates to seek similar resolution of other disputes involving places of worship. The organisation has said that it will not. Much also will depend on how the Muslim parties to the dispute react to the judgment. Seeking a review of the decision is within their rights, although they must respect the verdict ? and they have said that they will. A compromise formula agreed to by some of the Muslim parties to the dispute has some commonalities with the verdict, which means that at least some of them do want to move on.

At the social level, there are two alternative ways to view the verdict. One is to see it as a deeply polarising judgment that alienates the country?s Muslims, some of whom already see themselves being targeted by a State they perceive to be majoritarian. The other is to see it as a unifying one, which addresses one of the most sticky issues in the country, and attempts to strike a balance. With that out of the way, Hindus and Muslims could well aspire to arrive at a new equilibrium, one that puts the country first.","Finally, a closure on Ayodhya",The Hindustan Times,
53,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"The majority of Congress leaders and workers believe that the Ram temple bhoomi pujan spectacle in Ayodhya on Wednesday, portrayed as a historic moment of triumph for Hindus, will allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi to divert the nation?s attention for a while but the real concerns would soon return to dominate the political discourse.

Although a section in the Congress, particularly ordinary party workers, is doubtless rattled and is in awe of Modi?s capacity to hijack the discourse, many senior leaders hope it is premature to presume that the tide of negativity against the government?s many failures and the multiple crises facing the nation has turned and the Ram temple will override other issues for the next few years.

They admit that Modi will create a much bigger hype at the time of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections and finally during the inauguration of the temple before the 2024 parliamentary polls, but its emotive appeal will diminish in the absence of any tangible opposition to its construction.


A leader told The Telegraph: ?There is no denying the fact that Modi has used this occasion for perception management. He had been grappling with the worst crisis of his political career: while the economy is in ruin, the humanitarian crisis caused by the coronavirus has demolished the myth of his administrative skills. No country has witnessed such distressing scenes of millions (of migrants) walking hundreds of miles without food or water. Unemployment created a deep unrest among youths.?

He added: ?Against the grim backdrop of multiple crises, his helplessness on the Chinese intrusion almost unravelled his image as a strong leader. He was obviously shaken and opted to organise this event even though there was no muhurt (auspicious timing) according to astrology.

?This was always going to be a momentous occasion and we knew the RSS-BJP would present it as a never-before moment of Hindu triumph. They have exhausted the opportunity too soon. It will be difficult to sustain the hype for long.?

Asked if the Congress had any internal discussion before Priyanka Gandhi Vadra set the tone by talking about Lord Ram signifying unification, righteousness and sacrifice without directly drawing a parallel with the RSS-BJP?s perceived divisive agenda, a party functionary said: ?There were discussions at informal levels. When nobody opposed the verdict delivered by the Supreme Court, the only course left for us was to highlight the dichotomy between the RSS-BJP?s narrow politics and Lord Ram?s philosophy.

?We knew the temple construction would benefit the BJP. It must have been the cynical assessment of all parties that the absence of any opposition to the construction of the temple would minimise the political advantage the RSS-BJP expects from the event. We hope this is true, no matter how hard they try to project it as a transformative occasion.?

Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, too, traversed the safe path laid by Priyanka, saying Lord Ram can never manifest himself through hatred, cruelty and injustice. Prime Minister Modi on Wednesday also dwelt on the lofty ideals of Lord Ram, no matter how divisive the campaign in the run-up to the event had been.

Rahul also made a subtle attempt to indicate that Modi?s politics had been antithetical to the ideals symbolised by Ram as it selectively targeted opposition, suppressed institutions, discriminated against minorities and ran an unjust regime without following the principles of transparency and accountability.

Rahul tweeted: ?Maryada Purushottam Bhagwan Ram is a symbol of supreme humane values. He is the essence of the intrinsic humanity that lies in our hearts. Ram is love; he can never manifest himself through hate. Ram is compassion; he can never manifest himself through cruelty. Ram is justice; he can never manifest himself through injustice.?

Congress leaders insist that the future political discourse will have to revolve around issues such as the economy, jobs, democratic values and foreign relations.

They say the intervention in the temple discourse has a limited purpose ? to send out a message that the Congress is not opposed to the construction and the BJP is not the sole representative of Hindus in India.

The Congress leaders also contest the perception that the party felt compelled to pursue ?soft Hindutva?, arguing that it never saw secularism as being irreligious.

A former Union minister told this newspaper: ?There are abnormal pressures of mass politics on certain occasions. We do have to temporarily alter the articulation when the atmosphere is surcharged, when emotions are running high and explaining nuances becomes difficult. But the core philosophy doesn?t change.

?Our stress on justice, on cultural harmony, on compassion? is an expression of our secular commitment in a different language. Those who have misunderstood will soon realise how fiercely we will safeguard the secular principles. That commitment is sacred.?",Ram temple: Congress awaits return of real concerns,The Telegraph,
54,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"The state must get tough on crime, but the police should not be allowed to break the law
The Uttar Pradesh Police?s account of the killing of Kanpur gangster Vikas Dubey on Friday, even if taken at face value, is a startling admission of serious ineptitude. But the official narrative, as it stands, stretches the bounds of credulity to an astonishing extent. The possibility that his death is officially sanctioned retribution for the murder of eight policemen who were part of the team that went to arrest him on July 3 is hard to dismiss out of hand. Without a doubt, Dubey?s death in an ?exchange of fire? while he was ?trying to flee? after the police vehicle in which he was being taken ?met with an accident? is also extremely convenient for many; it puts a lid on the sordid tale of his violent rise to power and influence, which was nourished by a wider network of patrons, including some in the police force. A hardened criminal, who had 62 cases against him before his gang allegedly shot dead eight policemen last week, was supposedly being transported without handcuffs; he snatched weapons from those escorting him, according to the police version of the incident. Indeed, this is no more than a self-indictment of the state police, whose conduct has raised far too many questions in the recent past. There is no good explanation for driving such a suspect through the night across more than 600 km from Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh where he was arrested on Thursday. The brutal last episode of Dubey?s serial crimes should be no defence if the shooting turns out to be an extra-judicial killing.

Any demand of probity and accountability in police and military is often contested on the supposed ground that it emerges from a support for criminals, terrorists or enemies of the state by influential political and public figures. There is no question that crimes such as those Dubey was involved in must be met with exemplary punishment. The process of establishing guilt and executing punishment is not an incidental part of justice, but its integral soul. A fair and transparent trial cannot be dispensed with in order to satisfy cries for vengeance. Social sanction of instant justice by state agents might have leached into institutions that are mandated to enforce the rule of law. Last year, when the Cyberabad police shot dead four people accused in a case of gang rape and murder, people celebrated in the streets. The courts and the National Human Rights Commission have also shown a lenient approach in such cases. Goading the police on to deliver instant justice, or even tolerating such behaviour, creates an atmosphere of impunity that could lead to murder of innocent people as happened with the custodial deaths in Tamil Nadu. Support for such killings by the police will not make a society more just. Mob justice is no justice at all. When law enforcers short-circuit due process, the damage to state institutions is severe and long-lasting.",Crime as punishment: On the killing of Vikas Dubey,The Hindu,
55,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"Six days of a broad manhunt later, fugitive gangster Vikas Dubey was arrested in Madhya Pradesh yesterday and handed over to the Uttar Pradesh police. Today morning he was killed. The UP police say Dubey fired at them after a road accident overturned their vehicle, and then they shot him in self-defense.

Even as commentators rip holes in the police story, the bigger giveaway is that this incident is part of a pattern. Three close aides of Dubey were killed in recent days in similar encounters in Etawah, Kanpur and Hamirpur. If those encounters were staged and the men shot dead in cold blood, then it?s obviously no justification that these men are accused of shooting dead eight policemen in Kanpur?s Bikru village last week. What is at stake is the rule of law, which UP police often seem to believe they are above.
In this particular case, another worry is that the police-criminal-political nexus that needed exposing in the Vikas Dubey case is now going to get a quiet burial. But that is the problem with men in khaki either being incompetent or running rogue. If the state has become incapable of upholding basic constitutional precepts, then the Supreme Court must step in and set it right.",Encounter Pradesh ? Where Vikas Dubey is shot dead before trial,The times of India,
56,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"Headline on Wednesday, July 10: Vikas Dubey arrested. Shabaash. Breaking news a little later: Vikas Dubey shot dead. Wah! Badhiya hai! How convenient. Let?s check out the various and very imaginative versions of this bloody drama.

The man with a murderous past was apparently ?caught? by a security guard at Ujjain?s Mahakal temple, after he and his wife bought prasad and performed aarti. The criminal on the run crossed several checkposts and travelled undetected across four states before getting nabbed. All of this sounds bogus to me.

 

A man who has been running a parallel state within a state for years in Yogi Adityanath?s Wild West territory, also known as Uttar Pradesh, gets picked up a few days later in another state (Madhya Pradesh) and then the ?usual? happens! He gets shot trying to ?escape? from a police party when a vehicle overturns! All this action takes place seven days after his henchmen ambush and gun down eight policemen in cold blood. Relax, everyone!

Now that the mastermind behind the attack has been bumped off, we will never get to know what exactly happened or why.

Let?s say it was a huge setup, with betrayals, informers, and political connivance involved. Nobody would dare to ambush and open fire on men in vardi, without being guaranteed protection by political bosses. Even the most hardened criminals hesitate before taking on the men in uniform. Dubey?s subsequent arrest and murder are clearly a part of the huge coverup, now that the game is up. It sounds like the most brazen and audacious political charade.

 

A total eyewash? and complete hogwash. The same men, from the same party that was working hand in glove with the criminal, seem to have struck a deal with political bosses of another party, and smoothly staged the arrest and encounter killing, but only after doing a deal with Vikas Dubey himself. Endgame!

This is how it has always worked in India. Nothing new about this narrative. There?s a blurred line between netas and goondas, political bosses and hardcore criminals ? this is true across parties. In fact, it?s pretty hard to distinguish one lot (gangsters) from the other (netas).

Sometimes, very rarely, the situation gets completely out of hand -- as it did in Dubey?s case. All hell breaks loose, but only for a while. You can be sure while citizens are kept distracted with hocus pocus stories about the valour and efficiency of the police party involved in the drama, frantic negotiations are taking place simultaneously between the criminal?s family, his gang members and their political patrons.

 

During the time all these hardworking folks are busy cutting deals and managing the division of loot, others are busy buying time, till all the stolen monies are secured and the incriminatory trails are fixed. This time is very precious indeed. It?s like the golden hour in medical terminology. Millions are at stake, and several mighty political reputations on the line.

The stash has to be protected at all costs, as also the identities of the political bosses for whom criminals like Vikas Dubey work. The money trail must be hastily covered up and as much evidence destroyed as possible. This needs the intervention of experts and techies, who can efficiently destroy files and create alibis. Generally, 48 hours are sufficient for eliminating all compromising evidence. Some inconvenient people can also be blown away along the way.

 

The few that are left behind can be managed with pressure from the investigating agencies. One just has to lean on them. In return for such big favours, the rewards are pretty impressive and there?s a well-understood modus operandi to fix remaining loopholes. The heat is turned up, only after all these areas are sealed. The rest is pure drama, scripted by intelligence officers and corrupt bureaucrats. It is an eyewash that only the gullible believe.

The ludicrous sequence of Dubey?s arrest and death has been better choreographed than some clumsier encounters from the past. It started with Dubey?s nephew being shot dead, with two compromised cops and four aides getting hauled in. Errrrr? the nephew has been the gangster?s shadow for the longest time. But of course nobody could find him? till now.

 

Gangsterism runs in the family and is conducted like any business across India. The rule of terror unleashed is so dreadful, not a single police thana dares to intrude into the well- fortified dens of men like Dubey, with heavily armed ?soldiers? protecting the don. Gangsters live their lives with complete impunity, with nobody to fear. Successive governments kowtow to them and openly display solidarity, by attending wedding and family functions. The looted money is shared by whichever neta happens to be in power.

Take a look at some of the photographs floating around of Dubey with several political leaders.

The multi-billion dollar question is this: Why has nobody as much as tried to crack the D-Gang nexus? For decades one heard stories about how seamlessly this global network of some of the most dangerous people alive operates. D-Gang watchers also know about the multiple business interests and dealings that have gone on without a break all these years.

The names of heavyweight politicians and movie stars who are business partners with underworld goons come up periodically. Despite all the buzz around these nefarious activities, no action is ever taken, nor any investigations launched. Whether it involves airline deals, real estate or Bollywood -- dhanda merrily stays dhanda -- no questions asked.

It?s a wonder Dubey was nabbed in the first place. Citizens were pretty certain he?d be provided safe passage out of India -- as have many other hardcore criminals before him. Making Dubey an example must have been an afterthought? and only because of the brazenness with which the sitting duck policemen were gunned down.

Those who tipped off the gangster about the raid have already been taken care of. Watch out for a fresh bunch of suspects who will be paraded before the media, and made to take the rap, while shielding the political patrons who set up the ambush in the first place, believing they?d get away with it yet again.

Well, they almost did! But like with everything else in life, it?s payout time now. Someone?s head has got to roll. Let it be Dubey?s?while his political bosses have the last laugh, which is, as always, on us!",Gangsterism in politics: Vikas Dubey in UP's Wild West,The Asian age,
57,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"After meekly surrendering in Ujjain on Thursday, the gangster mustered enough courage Friday to snatch a gun from the police and fire at them. If the state had bothered to corroborate this outlandish script, the cop who allowed Dubey to take his service weapon should have been suspended by now.
Notorious gangster Vikas Dubey?s end came in the same dramatic manner as that of many others who have had their share of infamy in the world of crime. India has seen his kind before ? men whose names spelt terror but destiny took them to their logical end when they finally fell to police bullets.

No one seems to dispute that Dubey deserved to meet his nemesis. Yet, the manner in which the Uttar Pradesh police silenced him forever has also conveniently shut the book of his chequered criminal career. That this book had unopened chapters which would have brought to the fore his obvious nexus with politicians who were there all along in his journey to making him an underworld don is what makes his killing in an encounter on Friday so controversial.

Dubey?s rise from local hoodlum to the position of a privileged gangster would not have been possible without the active patronage of successive UP state governments and their leaders, who were always ready to keep their doors open for him. The gangster came in handy for them when they needed his support at the time of elections ? not only to garner the local Brahmin vote in Kanpur (Dehat) district, but to also provide them muscle power.

Dubey earned his spurs as a dreaded gangster with the sensational daylight murder of a prominent Bhartiya Janata Party leader, Santosh Shukla, whom he gunned down inside the precincts of a rural police station precisely 19 years ago. It was a bright and pleasant afternoon on October 12, 2001, when local villagers and policemen helplessly watched Dubey pump half a dozen bullets into Shukla?s temple and chest from point blank range.

That was the day his area saw the birth of a don. When the trial court eventually acquitted him, he quickly rose to become the uncrowned king of the world of crime in and around Kanpur (Dehat). ?Lack of evidence? and the absence of a single eyewitness set him free. Though there was nothing unusual for ordinary eyewitnesses in UP to turn hostile when it comes to deposing before a court of law, what Dube managed to do was exercise his undue influence even on uniformed policemen drawing their salaries from the state exchequer. Each of the two dozen odd policemen present in the police station at the time of Shukla?s murder deposed before the court that they had not seen anything. Sure enough, if the government of the day wanted ? the state was ruled by a BJP regime headed by Rajnath Singh when Shukla was killed and the trial ran ? no policeman could have dared to depose in a manner that would help the murderer to get away. Yet, that is what happened ?  despite the fact that Shukla was senior enough in the party?s pecking order to have been accorded the rank of a minister in the government despite losing his own election.

Shukla held Dubey responsible for turning the election tide against him by extending support to his Bahujan Samaj Party rival, Harish Chandra Srivastava. He made it a point to get several criminal complaints registered against Dubey, who did not figure in the list of local criminals until then.

Sure enough, Shukla?s cold blooded murder followed by Dubey?s acquittal became a turning point in his career of crime. Governments came and went in the subsequent years but Dubey?s clout grew with each ruling dispensation ? be it the BSP, Samajwadi Party or the BJP. The reason was simple ? everyone found his caste and muscle potential ?useful? in serving their respective political ambitions.

The caste-ridden politics of Uttar Pradesh led him to emerge as some kind of a Brahmin strongman, who could ensure the votes of his community within his domain of influence that was growing by leaps and bounds. Irrespective of political party, his followers would go all the way for whoever Dubey backed. And the parties paid him back too with their support. When his wife contested a zila panchayat election, he managed to get her the support of both the SP and BJP. Posters with leaders of both parties were put up on display.

Among the leaders of various parties the gangster was seen posing proudly in pictures for is Brijesh Pathak, once a BSP MP and currently law minister in the Yogi Adityanath government.

Known for switching loyalties with every change of guard in Lucknow, Dubey had his well-wishers in all parties. It was his close connections with people who matter that made it convenient for him to get ?arrested? on Thursday outside the Maha-Kal temple in Madhya Pradesh?s Ujjain, where he managed to reach after travelling at least 1400 km via Delhi, Faridabad and Rajasthan.

By effecting his arrest in Ujjain in full view of the public, Dubey hoped to save himself from an ?encounter? which he felt the UP police was bent upon carrying out. However, whatever assurances he had received proved to be useless. Within hours of being handed over to the UP police, he was shot dead. And with that, the lid has been put on a Pandora?s Box that could have spilled the identities of political bigwigs in his network. That the dead do not speak is a big source of relief for all those who had their nexus with him and were worried about getting exposed were he to survive.

And that clearly includes not only those belonging to the political class but also the black sheep in the police.

So it came to pass that the dreaded gangster who meekly went into custody ? when he was supposedly spotted and cornered in an Ujjain temple by a priest and flower-seller, who tipped off temple security and in turn, the police ? mustered enough courage to not only snatch a gun from the policemen who were bringing him home in a highly secured vehicle escorted by four other vehicles but even fired shots at them.

If the UP police are to be believed, he also managed to flee from the police vehicle, which tumbled somewhere along on the route after encountering a ?herd of cows? (what else!), thereby compelling the contingent of some six dozen policemen to shoot him down after a brief ?chase?.

If the police had taken care to corroborate their outlandish script, the officer who proved incapable of protecting his own service weapon should have been suspended or fired by now. In any case, less said the better about a a well-equipped police contingent being unable to keep a dangerous fugitive under their physical control.

Top criminal lawyers of Lucknow find the story ?too nave? and ?utterly weak?even for a fourth-rate Bollywood thriller. ?Vikas Dubey?s encounter shows that the UP government does not believe in the criminal justice system laid down in our democratic constitution; they neither need courts nor lawyers; their police decides who is a criminal and they award the punishment?, senior advocate I.B.Singh told The Wire. ?In my long judicial career I have come across several fake encounters, but never before have I experienced any carried out as shoddily as this one , which simply reflects the contempt that the UP police has for the law of the land of which they are supposed to be the guardians.?

Another senior lawyer, L.P.Misra, said, ?I wonder if we are still living in a democratic state where the police appear to be turning into criminals?. First, the cops went about demolishing Dubey?s house in gross violation of law and in the bargain also destroyed evidence. And now they have killed him in cold blood ? and they call it encounter.?",The Real Story is Not Vikas Dubey's 'Encounter' but the Chapters His Killing Has Closed,The Wire,
58,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"The case of Vikas Dubey, the gangster who was arrested by the Madhya Pradesh police in Ujjain on Thursday, nearly a week after eight policemen in his pursuit were killed near Kanpur, exemplifies a crisis in Uttar Pradesh police. At the time of his arrest, Dubey had at least 60 cases, including murder, to his name. Since the July 3 ambush in his village, Dubey evidently travelled three states even as the UP police gunned down five of his accomplices, bulldozed his house, and arrested two policemen on the suspicion that they were his moles in the force. As evidence of the wanton short-circuiting of the rule of law in l?affaire Dubey ? the chilling ?encounter culture? and the alleged complicities within the system ? comes to light, the police now needs to ensure that Dubey has his day in court. That even criminals have a right to due process is a principle the UP administration has, by all accounts, been guilty of giving the go-by in recent times. Though the Supreme Court has declared encounter killings as unlawful, seniors ministers and the chief minister himself, have signalled their endorsement to this disturbing phenomenon, even touting it as a major achievement in office. Taking a cue from the apparent political sanction, senior police officials have publicly owned and celebrated encounter killings, forcing the National Human Rights Commission to issue notices to them.

The Dubey case has all the markings of a disquieting nexus that involves politicians, policemen and criminals. Bahubalis, as criminals often associated with politicians are known in UP and Bihar, have been an integral part of the political landscape in these states for decades. Adityanath had promised a clean-up of law and order in UP when he came to power, and his government even claims it as an achievement. However, a culture of encounters and police impunity appears to have been boosted in UP. An apparent disdain for due process has emboldened the police force to use excessive force against criminals and protesters alike ? the disproportionate police response and the stamping down of all protests during the anti-CAA mobilisations last year were part of the same pattern.

Now, the government will be watched on how it handles the Dubey case. The UP police must know, and if they don?t, they must be told that in a society governed by the rule of law, the death of policemen cannot be avenged by the encounters of criminals. Considering the scale and scope of the alleged crime and conspiracy, including the possible involvement of public officials, it will be prudent for the government to entrust the probe to an independent and impartial agency immediately.",Murky Vikas Dubey case is a test that UP government and police can ill afford to fail,The Indian Express,
59,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"It is surreal that the fugitive criminal Vikas Dubey, who surrendered to the Madhya Pradesh police at Ujjain on Thursday, is then shot dead by the UP police on Friday morning ? allegedly because he tried to snatch a gun and escape when the vehicle carrying him in a police convoy overturned at Kanpur (the only vehicle to do so).

Incidentally, the media, which was shadowing the convoy, was stopped 15 minutes before the incident. It is evident that the killing was nothing more than a brazen act of extra-judicial execution. It may not be shocking, but it is nothing if not condemnable.

Not many in UP would bat an eye at this gruesome shortcut of justice. Popular bloodlust for summary justice ? as witnessed last December when the Telangana police was feted for shooting dead the four accused in a veterinarian's rape-murder on Hyderabad?s outskirts ? continues to be fed by a political class that was complicit in Dubey?s crimes.

The extra-judicial execution cannot be justified on the grounds that Dubey?s men killed eight policemen. The Constitution gives everyone the right to a fair trial under Article 14, and Article 21 renders a fair trial as part of any individual?s guarantee of life and personal liberty.

An extra-judicial execution is unconstitutional. The absence of due process subverts not only the criminal justice system but democracy as well. It might sit well with a cynical populace impatient with the slow wheels of justice.

But it erodes the fabric of our democracy and society in ways that are much graver than an extra-judicial execution. One way is the manner of late in which the victims of riots are charged as the culprits, or in which dissenting students are deemed more anti-national than actual terrorists.

Vikas Dubey was a bad man. He had over 60 cases to his name including five in which he was directly accused of murder. In 2001, he reportedly killed a state minister ? inside a police station. Yet he would not have thrived for so long had it not been for the police-criminal-politician nexus that has existed for longer than most Indians have been alive.

Kunda MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya, for instance, is one of many notorious politicians with a long criminal record. In UP the politician-criminal nexus is so widespread that any Netflix crime serial is by default set in UP.

In Dubey?s case, there was much talk of how he could have spilled the beans on the high and mighty ? a former CM said if his vehicle had not toppled, the government would have ? and it is speculated that five of the 12 named in the police deaths FIR were ?encountered? because of such links.

Killing Dubey might have been an act of self-preservation by the UP police. In which case society must accept that Dubey?s extra-judicial execution is no panacea to UP?s (or India?s) law and order problems; it only preserves and perpetuates the dirty, lawless and corrupt status quo.","Vikas Dubey is dead, long live UP?s neta-thug net",Deccan Chronicle,
60,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"The UP police theory on why it killed Vikas Dubey doesn?t stand to reason. The politico-criminal nexus will never be exposed

UP gangster Vikas Dubey may not have anyone mourning his death in a stage-managed accident cum encounter, responsible as he was for many killings, the last being of eight policemen. But does this sit easy on the conscience of the police, which has put out the most outrageous and improbable theory of his attempt to escape, one that triggered it to open fire? Is it not its job to deliver the culprit for courts to decide? Does it not indicate that the political patrons of Dubey and their protector policemen had too much to lose had the don spilled details of the unholy politician-criminal nexus that has entrenched itself in the State in a mutually self-serving manner? Does this not damage Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath?s image of a no-nonsense leader with zero tolerance for corruption and mafia, for good, considering he was personally supervising Dubey?s case? Or is it that his individual will stands no chance in front of systemic imperatives, which his party, too, has endorsed? Dubey himself was sensing that he would be eliminated, what with the police announcing a bounty on his head and five of his aides killed in orchestrated scenarios. So he surrendered, to negotiate a longish jail term for the right to live. But his protectors and creators were scared that with all the media attention on his arrest, he could have just spilled the beans or leaked prized information. So they got rid of him. This haste is troublesome for the simple reason that had the police followed processes and built a solid case on his killing of their colleagues in Kanpur, they could have anyway got the death sentence for him. Even assuming that some among the forces had tipped Dubey about an impending raid, which he used as a trap to ambush the cops, the UP police could have used his past crimes to justify the severest penalty. Why did it feel so disadvantaged and compromised as to ignore the provisions of the law and shoot to kill? Unless the men in uniform were told to play executioner. The sad part is that the focus has now shifted from Dubey, the criminal, to Dubey, the victim of police excesses. And nobody is even discussing the heinous nature of his crimes. This, too, is then an equal travesty of justice.

According to the UP police, while Dubey was being transported back to the State, one of the cars in the convoy overturned. Taking advantage of the situation, he allegedly attempted to snatch a weapon and flee the scene, following which the police opened fire and shot him. If the narrative sounds familiar, that is because it is. Most of Dubey?s aides died in such ?encounters? after ?attacking? the police and trying to ?escape.? It matters little why the policemen ?conveniently? forgot to secure their weapons as per rules, did not handcuff Dubey or how he managed to escape from an upturned car with all doors shut. The police theorists also forgot to factor how a car that skids on a smooth tarmac doesn?t leave tyre marks. In the end, many questions will be left hanging like aerosols that disintegrate beyond a certain point in time. Who were the political leaders who promoted the mobster?s criminal empire and his clout? Which all policemen in the force are in cahoots with criminals? The fact that deputy SP Devendra Mishra, who was among the eight policemen killed, had warned his seniors of Dubey?s hold over the justice system but was ignored speaks a lot about the don?s clout. Which netas are involved with criminals in the State? Dubey, who has been patronised by the ruling BJP and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) at various times, had of late tried to curry favour back with the BJP. Apart from intensifying caste wars for votebank consolidation, he was also a quick facilitator of land and business deals that political parties, their sponsors and bureaucrats found attractive. So, who is the UP Government trying to protect? India is a democracy after all and even criminals with such intimidating rap sheets like Dubey?s have a right to justice, representation and being heard in a court of law. Besides the Supreme Court has declared encounter killings as unlawful. But it is very obvious that the Adityanath administration and senior Ministers have given their tacit approval to this ?encounter culture? which abounds in the State as does police impunity. And with the killing of Dubey, one wonders if Adityanath is indeed serious about flushing out criminals and cleaning up the police at the same time. If we do not break the politico-police-criminal axis, cleansing is not possible. In a society governed by the rule of law, the death of a policeman cannot be avenged by encounters of criminals. Considering the scale of Dubey?s crimes and the involvement of Government officials and politicians, the State Government should have entrusted the probe to an independent and impartial agency immediately after the arrest of the don and his henchmen. But it seems the Government, too, is trying to protect someone, somewhere and has given the police a carte blanche. Will we ever know?",Encounter the truth,The Pioneer,
61,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"Vikas Dubey is dead. On Thursday, when he was arrested in Ujjain, this newspaper argued that his arrest must mark the beginning ? not the end ? of the story about the nexus between politics and crime in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and a broken administrative and police system. But there appear to have been forces which did not want that story told. On Friday morning, in highly mysterious circumstances, Dubey died, and so did the story he may have told.

It is important to reiterate first principles here. Dubey was a gang lord; his list of crimes was long; he allegedly led the attack and killing on eight policemen in Kanpur last week. Such a man deserved to be punished for his crimes. But India prides itself on the rule of law. When a crime is allegedly committed, a process kicks in. The perpetrator is arrested, contingent on judicial sanction. Suspects are questioned. Evidence is amassed. Interrogations are conducted. A case is built up. The court examines the evidence and testimonies; the defendant has a right to legal defence. On the merits of the case, based on the law, the judiciary hands down its decision, which can then be appealed against. In a civilised society, this process is undertaken, not just because the guilty is presumed to be innocent until convicted, but because this is the only way to sustain the legitimacy of the system and prevent arbitrary exercise of power. Even Ajmal Kasab, caught red-handed in the 26/11 attacks, got a trial.

In UP, there appears to be a pattern where this process is, often, not followed. There have been a spate of extrajudicial killings ? encounters, in popular parlance ? since the current government took office in 2017. This is attributed to a stern approach where patience for due process is limited. Even before Friday, this impatience with process, the desire to satiate the thirst for instant justice, as well as, more controversially, ensure Dubey did not speak about his political and bureaucratic linkages were being seen as factors that would cut short his life. The circumstances of his death ? he was shifted into another vehicle before the shoot-out; journalists following the convoy were stopped before the encounter took place; the absence of evidence to show how his car overturned ? will only add motive to mystery. If UP wants to set an example, it must institute an independent probe on the manner of Dubey?s killing and his entire network. India may have one less criminal today, but it has also fallen short of its own principles.",Vikas Dubey?s mysterious death ,The Hindustan Times,
62,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"Murders by the police ingenuously called ?encounter? deaths have been turned into policy by the UP chief minister
Gullibility is not one of the seven deadly sins, or the Indian people might have been condemned for it. For it is not just Vikas Dubey, responsible for the murders of eight policemen, who was killed in an ?encounter? when he allegedly tried to escape while being transported by the police from Ujjain to Kanpur, but also five of his co-accused, who were killed in less publicized ?encounters? in the six days that Dubey remained elusive. The events from the arrest ? was it surrender? ? to the death ? which car turned over? ? of a criminal accused of numerous murders long before the police killings yet running free with barely concealed political backing are enveloped in a fog of clashing claims. It is remarkable that police officers, not just politicians, are unworried that their statements may sound incredible or contradictory, or their acts may be revealing ? the media were stopped from following the police entourage just before the accident that made the encounter possible ? because the Uttar Pradesh government seems convinced of the Indian people?s gullibility. Any old fairytale will do, even an oft-repeated one.

There may be another reason. Murders by the police ingenuously called ?encounter? deaths have been turned into policy by the UP chief minister. In February 2018, government records show that the police were conducting four encounters daily, targeting those they, or the state, decided were guilty of something. That is a crime. Completely bypassing the law, the Constitution and judicial processes in the name of establishing order has created a culture where the police have probably forgotten all procedures except killing. A day before Dubey?s death, a petition in the Supreme Court asked that his security be ensured during arrest, citing the encounter deaths of his five followers. The Supreme Court?s earlier directions in case of encounter deaths are irrelevant in UP. If Dubey?s reported closeness to people in power led to his death before being brought to court, that is a manifestation of the politician-criminal link and the criminal-turned-politician phenomenon that the courts and the Election Commission have been fighting against. But as frightening is the fact that in UP no one objects to encounter killings; fear and violence have poisoned people?s perception. There is nothing innocent or foolish about this pretence of gullibility.",Free run: The Vikas Dubey killing,The Telegraph,
63,Triple Talaq bill becomes a law,"Making triple talaq a criminal offence is unnecessary and possibly counter-productive
The Centre?s proposal to make instant triple talaq an offence punishable with three-year imprisonment and a fine is an unnecessary attempt to convert a civil wrong into a criminal act. By a three-two majority, the Supreme Court has already declared, and correctly, that the practice of talaq-e-biddat, or instant divorce of a Muslim woman by uttering the word ?talaq? thrice, is illegal and unenforceable. While two judges in the majority said the practice was arbitrary and, therefore, unconstitutional, the third judge ruled that it was illegal because it was contrary to Islamic tenets. Its consequence is that the husband?s marital obligations remain, regardless of his intention in pronouncing it. When Parliament enacts a law to give effect to the judicial invalidation of talaq-e-biddat, it must primarily ensure protection to Muslim women against its use. Although the details are not yet available, the proposed Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017, appears to have provisions for maintenance or subsistence allowance to the wife and children in the event of triple talaq being pronounced. It seeks to preserve the woman?s entitlement to custody of her children. While these are welcome and necessary features of a law aimed to protect the rights of Muslim women against arbitrary divorce, it hardly requires iteration that the civil character of these aspects of marital law must be preserved.

Instant triple talaq is viewed as sinful and improper by a large section of the community itself. Therefore, there can be no dispute about the need to protect Muslim women against the practice. But it is also well established that criminalising something does not have any deterrent effect on its practice. That there have been 66 cases of its use after the Supreme Court verdict only underscores the need for protecting women against desertion and abandonment, but is it justified to send someone to jail? Also, the fine amount under consideration could as well be awarded as maintenance or subsistence allowance. The All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen president, Asaduddin Owaisi, has argued in a letter to the Union Law Minister that there is no need for a fresh criminal provision when existing laws, under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code or provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, already allow the prosecution of a husband for inflicting physical or mental cruelty, emotional and economic abuse, and for deprivation of financial resources. Regardless of whether instant talaq would fall under any of these forms of cruelty or domestic violence, criminalising it risks defeating the objective of preserving the husband?s legal obligations, and the payment of maintenance. The Centre would do well to reconsider its draft and limit its scope to providing relief to women, instead of creating a new offence out of a civil matter.",Divorce as crime: on instant triple talaq,The Hindu,
64,Triple Talaq bill becomes a law,"The passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill criminalising instant oral talaq in the Rajya Sabha fulfils a BJP electoral promise. The party?s Hindutva base and even a number of Muslims opposed to the writ of religious leaders and personal laws reigning supreme in their community have welcomed the moment. By prescribing three years imprisonment for Muslim men who pronounce the talaq-e-biddat, the law sticks out with rough edges for treating divorce as a criminal offence.

From a system which gave archaic personal laws a long rope for decades to now criminalising practices like triple talaq that it fostered, India is veritably swinging between extremes. The old order had to change, but it is unfortunate that the new law failed to strike a balance. Personal laws gave religious leaders disproportionate influence and denied many people, especially women, the benefits of living in a free society and under meaningful protection of the state. By overriding personal laws, government is indeed doing Muslim women a world of good but in failing to treat triple talaq as a civil offence, as in any other messy divorce case, it may conceivably end up doing more harm than good to the woman.

A legal challenge in Supreme Court is certain to raise issues like proportionality: whether the severity of punishment befits the seriousness of the crime and whether there are less onerous ways of achieving the legislation?s goals. In a sense the social and political cost of not having a Uniform Civil Code, which would have been in tune with the secular ethos of the country, is showing. From Congress ?appeasement? of minorities ? or to be more precise clerics within minority communities in the hope they would deliver a ?vote bank? ? the pendulum has now swung to the other extreme where, under a Hindutva-oriented government, the law appears to have a punitive edge for Muslim men.

In a contrary scenario, a UCC would have united the country in true fashion where citizens irrespective of religion would follow the same laws for marriage, divorce, succession, etc. This government has a manifesto that promises UCC and a mandate that can make it happen. It must bite the bullet while earning trust by upholding, rather than debunking, other aspects of secularism as well.",Make it win-win: Personal laws permitting triple talaq had to go but criminalising it spawns new injustices,The times of India,

The issue of triple talaq is definitely real in India. For decades, many Muslim women activists have been engaged in a struggle to change discriminatory family laws. (Illustration by: Suvajit Dey)
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, now a law, has been hailed as a victory for gender justice by Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and other supporters of the Bill. The question is: Will this law really provide justice to Muslim women? To answer it, we need to inspect the Bill?s content as well as the intention with which it has been brought in.

The issue of triple talaq is definitely real in India. For decades, many Muslim women activists have been engaged in a struggle to change discriminatory family laws. The agenda had been holistic, covering not only one form of talaq but traditions like halala and polygamy and demanding a more comprehensive ?gender just law?. The intention was to bring Muslim women into the gamut of secular family laws, which are applicable to all other women from all religions in India. However, the current Act is a far cry from such an objective.

The Bill has many flaws. Its first provision says: ?Any pronouncement of talaq by a Muslim husband upon his wife, by words either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever shall be void and illegal.? In fact, such a practice had already been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in its judgment on August 21, 2017. The SC had sought legislation in support of its judgment and the law would have been sufficient with just this one section. However, the government has included unwarranted criminal provisions in the Bill.

The next provision talks about punishment of the husband with imprisonment up to three years and a fine. This is, in itself, a contradiction. If triple talaq has no legal validity (by virtue of the SC verdict), how can you punish it? Also, the personal laws of all communities are civil matters. This is the first time that criminal provisions are being laid out in matters of marriage and divorce.

The next provision talks about the husband providing a subsistence allowance. How can a jailed person provide money? Further, the woman in a case of triple talaq, will receive no support from her in-laws, since she will be seen as being responsible for putting her husband in jail.

There are existing laws which protect Hindu women and those from other communities in cases of domestic violence. Instead of this new law, in case a husband insists on triple talaq by unlawful means, he could have been booked under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. A common gender-just law could be a solution, rather than separate religion-specific laws. The BJP has batted for a common civil code since decades. Ironically, when the time came, they opted for a sharia-based law.

Currently, there is a sense of apprehension in the Muslim community, given the backdrop of mob lynching and the talk by political leaders of imposing the National Register of Citizens not only in the Northeast but across the country. The fear is that the triple talaq law will be used as a tool to harass men from the community.

The way in which the Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha is also a concern. Many members who opposed it in the debate helped the BJP by remaining absent during voting. This was irresponsible and shows apathy towards issues concerning Muslims.

This law will only serve the political purpose of the BJP. Affected Muslim women will continue to suffer. In fact, the law will add to their suffering.","Instead of a separate law on triple talaq, Centre should have framed a just law for all",The Indian Express,
66,Triple Talaq bill becomes a law,"The practice of instant triple talaq would not have been considered just or fair by anyone. The Supreme Court had declared it to be un-Islamic, arbitrary and not an integral part of religious practice two years ago. Hence the fact that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government got the Muslim women (protection of rights on marriage) bill, 2019 passed by both Houses of Parliament can be perceived as ensuring for women of that faith a form of justice of which they had been cruelly deprived. It is ungracious to accuse Narendra Modi?s government of concealed intentions on the occasion of this important step. The present government?s decisiveness must be placed in the context of democratically-minded society?s indisputable failure: it has for more than 70 years deplored the practice of instant triple talaq without doing anything about it. Either the fear of losing votes or the hesitation to approach what was projected as part of personal law appeared to prevent earlier governments from addressing the injustice traditionally faced by a section of the electorate. This failure in upholding the principle of equity in a democratic State was nothing short of opportunistic.

The confusion seems to have persisted. The Opposition?s objections to the instant triple talaq bill in its present form are based on the provision that penalizes the pronouncement of instant triple talaq with imprisonment and a fine. This leaves the family helpless. Those opposing the provision see it as a way to destroy families of the minority community by using its own practices and imprisoning its men, while the assumption behind the bill is that the practice cannot be ended without criminalizing it. Had the parties opposing the bill been serious, they would have had a chance if they had opposed it together in the Rajya Sabha, or at least insisted, as some suggested, that it be taken to a review committee. By walking out, abstaining and remaining absent, a number of parties opposing the bill and individual members of the Opposition made sure that the bill was passed. In other words, the objections were a show, as though the parties that walked out or the members who were absent wanted to put their protest against the criminalization of instant triple talaq on record without taking the risk of being identified as those who opposed the bill.

67,GDP collapse post Lockdown,"The inevitable has happened. India?s GDP suffered its steepest contraction on record in the April-June quarter, as output shrank 23.9% from a year earlier, provisional data show. It is evident that the stringent COVID-19 lockdowns in force through the first third of the quarter, and substantially in May, hollowed out demand. Private consumption spending, which accounts for almost 60% of GDP, contracted 26.7% as consumers abjured almost all discretionary spending. And exports, which contribute to a fifth of GDP and reflect overseas demand for Indian goods and services, shrank by nearly 20%. Investment activity was the worst-hit, collapsing 47% and shrinking in share of GDP to about 22% from 32% a year earlier as larger businesses conserved cash and refrained from any capital spending in the face of uncertainty, and smaller firms prioritised survival. Across the real economy, every single industry and services sector shrank with the solitary exception of agriculture, which grew 3.4% and outpaced the year earlier quarter?s 3% expansion. Construction suffered the most, plunging 50%, followed by the omnibus services category ? trade, hotels, communication, transport and broadcasting ? which shrank 47%, hit by the pandemic-linked restrictions. Manufacturing too took a severe beating, contracting 39% as demand for products deemed non-essential evaporated, and factories, even after reopening, struggled to run amid shortages of labour and added safety norms.

It was left to the government to keep the bottom from falling out on demand as the Centre?s pandemic mitigation expenditure helped expand its consumption spending by 16.4% year-on-year and softened the overall blow to GDP. However, with the fiscal deficit already having exceeded the full-year?s budgeted target in just the first four months, and revenue receipts impacted by the economic contraction, the government is unlikely to maintain a similar trend in expenditure growth over the next three quarters. Unless, of course, it is prepared to forsake its vaunted fiscal conservatism and finds innovative ways to mobilise resources. The still rising trajectory of new COVID-19 infections and a high level of job losses and income erosion are also sure to retard any recovery in momentum. If the latest survey-based data from IHS Markit show manufacturing PMI for August signalling growth for the first time in five months, the same researcher?s findings also stress that ?job shedding continues at a strong rate? in the industry. Equally significantly, the output numbers which are expected to undergo revision given the acknowledged difficulties in collecting data, do not capture a swathe of informal sector activity that was severely impacted. Agriculture too faces headwinds in the form of higher-than-ideal rainfall in August in several key crop growing regions in western and central India and with the impact of recent farm market ordinances yet to play out, it may be a while before the end of the tunnel is sighted.",Inevitable collapse: on steepest contraction of GDP,The Hindu,

The economy badly tanked in April, when there was a complete lockdown. Even the agriculture sector, which works out in the open and could have continued normally, was adversely impacted due to collapse in demand and freezing of trade and transportation. Arrivals in North Indian mandis had fallen to half of what they were in April 2019. Floriculture, horticulture, vegetables, poultry and milk are some of the commodities which suffered. Though the rabi crop was a record, agriculture production as a whole would have risen little in April-May.

Production of essentials was permitted during the lockdown, but fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms faced a decline. Most people could not go to work, so roads were empty and offices and factories were shut. Government offices were also closed and only the essential administration and police were functional. All in all, the economy would have been working at less than 25% of its level in April 2019.

As the lockdown was eased in stages from May, activity started to recover. But it still could not have been more than 40% of the level in May 2019. In June with Unlock 1, more activity was allowed but by all accounts many services were not allowed and this sector constitutes 55% of the GDP. So, the economy could not have been working at more than 60%.

In brief, during the period of April to June, the economy was down about 57% compared to the level in 2019. Even if one assumes very optimistically that the economy was functioning at 40%, 50% and 70% of the last year?s levels in April, May and June 2020, the decline in GDP for this period would be 47% and not 23.9%. Why is the official data not reflecting this decline in the GDP?

The reason is, as this author has been pointing out since the time of demonetisation, that the unorganised sector decline is not captured in the GDP data. It is not captured in the annual GDP data and even less so in the quarterly data which has been released since 1996. In fact, the quarterly data does not even fully capture the organised sector. It is based on very limited data like the Index of Industrial Production, a few hundred corporate sector companies whose reports are released, railways traffic and banking data. All these represent the organised sector only. Agriculture is the only component of the unorganised sector whose data is used. So, the rate of growth of -23.9% announced now is largely the rate of decline of the organised sector.

The unorganised sector is 94% of employment and 45% of output of the economy. Agriculture is its biggest component and its data is available but for the rest, the data is unavailable. It is collected once in five years and in between it is assumed that the organised sector can be used to proxy the unorganised sector also. This is not true after a shock like demonetisation or the lockdown.

The unorganised sector other than agriculture was hit the hardest by the lockdown. Units here do not have much working capital and this gets exhausted as work stops. Demand for its output also drops sharply as people are confined to homes. These reasons also prevented this sector from reviving after the easing of lockdown. If the organised sector declined by the official figure of 23.9%, the unorganised sector would have declined by 70% 80% during Q1.

The official document giving the data for Q1, titled ?Estimates Of Gross Domestic Product For The First Quarter, (April-June) Of 2020-21? says, ?There has been an impact on the economic activities as well as on the data collection mechanisms. ?the usual data sources were substituted by alternatives like GST??.

This lets the cat out of the bag. Data was hardly collected for April and May due to the lockdown. The data for Index of Industrial Production and Consumer Price Index could not be obtained. Companies were given time till September to file their quarterly reports. GST payment due in March was allowed to be postponed to June. Consequently, only the companies doing well or not too badly announced their results. Use of this data will then give an upward bias to the growth rate. Similarly, use of June data for GST will give an upward bias to the growth rates.

So, the official document says, ?Estimates are therefore likely to undergo revisions ??.

Clearly, the figure of decline of 23.9% represents only the organised sector and even this will be revised downwards. Revision of quarterly estimates of growth has been routine in the last one year and this year will be no exception given the huge uncertainty in data. It also portends that the next quarter will also be dismal given the poor consumer sentiment, low business confidence and continued difficulties in the unorganised sector and the services sectors.

India has become the worst performing economy among the G20 nations in April to June quarter. Britain is the next worst at -20.4% and China is the best performing with a positive rate of growth of 3.2%. Within one quarter, China turned around from -6.8% decline to a positive rate of growth. Why is India impacted far more than other G20 countries?

First, the lockdown was not properly implemented, so the benefit of lockdown could not be obtained. The lockdown is being eased while the number of cases are rising rapidly. The first round of attack is proliferating and the number of infections are increasing creating huge uncertainty. Repeated local lockdowns have had to be ordered, which disrupts production. Second, as mentioned above, there is a very large unorganised sector unlike other big economies. People in this sector are poor and cannot cope with a crisis. The authorities have ignored this factor.

Third, a large number of people are alienated from the system and lack faith in the authorities. So, they flout official pronouncements. Some people believe that this is a manufactured crisis and the authorities are fooling them. Often, one sees people going around without masks and not maintaining physical distancing. This enables the virus to proliferate. This is also the lesson from countries that have been successful in controlling the spread of the disease ? the moment there is laxity, the disease starts proliferating again.

Thus, there are long-term factors which make India?s situation worse than that of other major economies. Even if one accepts the official data, the Indian economy is in depression and not just recession. It will take a long time to get out of it ? till expectations change. For that, the government needs to change its stance from cautious to bold.",What the 23.9% Drop in Q1 GDP Tells ? and Doesn?t Tell ? Us About the Economy ,The Wire,
69,GDP collapse post Lockdown,"There is no doubt that COVID-19 has engulfed the entire world in just a few months. The closure of industrial units and the complete halt of air, rail and road traffic added to the woes of an economy under strain. But the government had received several warnings about the looming crisis.

The first five years of the Narendra Modi government were marked by two major steps ? demonetisation and GST
The politics of the RSS-BJP combine is responsible for the current state of the economy ? the unprecedented decline of the GDP to -23.9 per cent ? and the immiseration of the country?s toiling people. Barely a year ago, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the goal of a $5-trillion economy by 2024-2025 was realisable. Last week, the FM invoked the notion of an ?act of God? while shrugging off the Centre?s responsibility of payments to states under GST.

There is no doubt that COVID-19 has engulfed the entire world in just a few months. The closure of industrial units and the complete halt of air, rail and road traffic added to the woes of an economy under strain. But the government had received several warnings about the looming crisis. The CPI had warned it about a recession and pointed out that the so-called reforms ? commercialisation of education and health, privatisation of public sector undertakings, reckless liberalisation to allow foreign capital in virtually every sector ? are not the solution to what ails the economy.

The first five years of the Narendra Modi government were marked by two major steps ? demonetisation and GST. Demonetisation ruined the informal sector, caused immense misery to the poor and failed in curbing corruption, terrorism and black money ? its ostensible aims. GST delivered a blow to the MSME sector, cut into the revenues of states, undermined the federal spirit of the country?s polity and made states dependent on the Centre?s mercy. Today, when state governments unable to pay salaries, the Centre advises them to take loans from the RBI.

State governments had to give up 60-70 per cent of their taxing powers, including the entire VAT regime, to usher in GST. They did so on the Centre?s assurance of compensation for the shortfall due to GST collection for five years.

The global financial meltdown of 2008 exposed the realities of the neoliberal order. During the debate on this issue, the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh claimed that the fundamentals of the Indian economy were strong enough to withstand the impact of the crisis. They also acknowledged the role of public sector banks and financial institutions. This crisis was triggered by the collapse of the two financial institutions because of excessive lending and failure in getting the loans repaid. NPAs are today the major problem faced by the banking sector. The Modi government has failed to take tangible action to recover these loans.

The COVID-19 lockdown was declared in the last week of March, even though India reported its first infection at the end of January. The government was busy making preparations for US President Donald Trump?s India visit. The BJP and RSS were aggressively breaking anti-CAA protests across the country, especially in Delhi, and polarising the people on communal lines.

Pseudo nationalism is being used to restrain resistance to such misrule, to stifle dissent. The federal character of the polity is being destroyed. We know of the almost summary abrogation of Article 370. The Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to the Constitution?s secular character. The dilution of reservations for marginalised people shows the government?s lack of commitment to the principles of social justice enshrined in the Constitution. At the same time, there is no let-up in the atrocities against people from SC/ST communities. Despite daily COVID-19 cases crossing 70,000 and opposition from many state governments, students are being forced to appear in all-India examinations like the JEE and NEET.

Faced with an insensitive government, the people should not be made to feel insecure. The Left should mobilise people and lead them in the struggle against this pro-corporate and communal government. At a time when right-wing ideologues declare that there is no opposition in the country, the Left should unite all secular democratic forces.","From mismanaging Covid to worsening economic distress, government missteps abound",The Indian Express,

Apples are causing Kashmiri farmers much distress as Rs 8,000 crore worth low-hanging fruits are inaccessible and need serious governmental help to pluck them and send them off to nationwide markets. It?s fascinating that the fall of one apple from a tree may have changed the very landscape of man?s knowledge about his planet and the Universe manifold when Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity as a major force of Nature, deducing it from the fact that a falling object wouldn?t otherwise start moving from rest. This was in the 17th century. Mankind has come a long way since Einstein?s genius postulated the Theory of Relativity in the 20th century.

The wisdom of at least one BJP minister doesn?t seem to have absorbed the lessons of history well enough to be able to distinguish between apples and oranges, or between apple and Apple, the corporate he is wooing to ease India?s economic slowdown. If not for maths, the bedrock of economics, we can?t distinguish where we stand as a people and know what our GDP is. The economy is now seen in freefall but, unlike Newton?s apple, not from gravity. A somewhat confused minister couldn?t distinguish between these two great mathematicians. But this is par for the course: he is convinced mathematics itself isn?t worth pursuing.

71,GDP collapse post Lockdown,"The first half of the fiscal year 2020-21 ends today. The year started under a nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25. While most lockdown restrictions have been withdrawn, especially in the second quarter, the economy is far from normal. India?s GDP suffered an annual contraction of 23.9% in the June quarter. Most private and institutional forecasts predict an annual contraction in the range of 5-10% this year. Neither the government, nor the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has a projection for this year?s GDP. In an interview to this newspaper, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman refused to speculate on the annual performance of the economy while noting that the fall in the first quarter?s GDP was quite substantial.

At a time when the economy continues to face a difficult challenge, the government has opened at least two avoidable political fronts which will disrupt a co-ordinated response on the economic front. The first is the GST compensation cess payment controversy with the states. The second is the political showdown on the three agriculture reform bills. It is unlikely that it will have to backtrack from its position on both these issues. There is also the question of policy interventions generating confidence and clarity. The government has banned onion exports even as it celebrates its agricultural reforms as giving unprecedented freedom to the farmers. RBI?s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting was abruptly postponed a day before it was supposed to begin; the government is yet to appoint external members to MPC.

There is a consensus that a process of sequential recovery is underway in the economy and GDP growth rates will be higher than what they were in the first quarter. There are two reasons why this is not good enough. First, the challenge is to catapult GDP to pre-pandemic levels as soon as possible. Most experts do not see this happening despite easing of lockdown restrictions. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index has been increasing continuously in August and September (except a slight fall in the week ending September 27). Yet, Nomura economists continue to project a contraction in every quarter of the current fiscal year. Second, with Covid-19 showing no signs of miraculously going away, both consumer and business sentiment will remain subdued. There is clearly a strong case to be made for a second stimulus, something the finance minister said she was open to in the interview.",The economy going forward,The Hindustan Times,
72,GDP collapse post Lockdown,"The Modi government has tried very hard to persuade all TV viewers that we are not in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic mismanagement disaster.

The Union finance minister?s delivered a five-part presentation on a plan for economic revival. But as Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said on an NDTV show, what everyone was waiting for, was a package for economic survival or relief funds.

This plan to pump up the economy through loans and privatisation at this time has met with criticism from independent thinking industrialists to economists, farmer associations to industrial trade unions, and across the opposition parties. Irrespective of different ideologies or vocations, everyone seems to agree that the economy cannot be jumpstarted when the urban and rural workers of our country have no food or cash and the families in the middle to lowest sections of the economy have lost jobs and are indebted.

But the central government appears to be in denial. 

The government has recycled many of its pre-coronavirus economic policies as its new Atmanirbhar Abhiyan (self-reliance movement) package.

Support to MSME, privatisation of the mining sector, expansion of airports, ports and highways and space exploration were the government?s key announcements in its 2020 Budget.

Now, these policies being pushed to increase the economic GDP at this time of global recession and anti-globalisation may end up costing the Indian public far more than it gives us. This government, which administered shocks to the economy with demonetization and GST, has not been known to count the cost of its policies. But our society, that is highly unequal and where different sections experience ?the economy? is vastly different ways, cannot afford these risky proposals. 

It is doubtful if anyone in India still needs convincing that after two terms of the UPA and one of the NDA, the cache of achievements of neoliberal growth since 1991 has disappeared into the Cayman islands or into NPAs or into the wealth of families of the Forbes list of billionaires.

Oxfam?s report of 2020 stated that the wealth of 63 Indian billionaires was higher than the Union Budget of 2018-19. We have been in a long phase of jobless growth and our spending on public infrastructure and services has been shrinking. As stated by experts studying urban growth, this is a state of ?accumulation without development?.

This has occurred along with a spike in the wilful, legitimised destruction of environmental resources. Those who say our choice is between growth and environment are wrong. Our governments have weaponised growth against the environment and its citizens. 

Persisting with such a growth model will now be harmful to humanity. Communities and movements in many parts of the world, who care about the earth and its inhabitants are demanding greener, slower and smaller economies that value social indicators over GDP, cooperation over competition, and leisure, creativity and connectedness at the centre of our social organisation. Why haven?t we seen such proposals in India?

The short answer may be that we are still in relief mode as our governments are yet to make adequate resources available for the needy like the stranded migrants, farmers and fishers who have lost their produce and the growing number of unemployed people.

These are certainly the issues deserving all attention due to the unimaginable levels of hunger and deprivation. But the lack of bold post COVID-19 proposals may also be because we have many economists who believe that India is too poor to shun the prevailing growth models.

We also have only a few economists who are willing to see beyond the model of a welfare state that is underpinned by a highly extractive economy. It is for this reason that shaping a post-pandemic world needs the full participation of activists, scholars and community organisations who can root the economy within a just society.

As members of an interconnected society we need to dictate our terms and conditions to the economic system rather than be controlled by its default logics. ",Why the Economic Crisis Shouldn't Become an Opportunity for More GDP Talk,The Telegraph,
73,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"Allahabad HC order quashing Dr. Kafeel Khan?s detention exposes state persecution
If ever any evidence was needed that Dr. Kafeel Khan, a government doctor from Gorakhpur, has been a victim of state persecution, the Allahabad High Court has provided that. Its 42-page order has laid bare the malefic manner in which the doctor was detained under the National Security Act (NSA) on February 13, 2020, shortly after he was granted bail in an earlier case. Dr. Khan, suspended in 2017 after a severe shortage of oxygen cylinders took a deadly toll among children admitted to the encephalitis ward in the Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital, Gorakhpur, was arrested on January 29, 2020, for an address to students of Aligarh Muslim University last December. His speech, which contained scathing criticism of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and its discriminatory nature, was deemed inflammatory weeks after he had made it. The High Court has now found that far from inciting Muslims, the speech, taken in its entirety, does not disclose any effort to promote hatred or violence; and nowhere does it threaten peace in Aligarh. The DM, Aligarh, the court says, used selective reading of some phrases and ignored its true intent while passing the detention order. No reasonable man, it says, would have come to the conclusion about the speech that the DM did. The grounds for detention under NSA provided nothing that indicated any attempt by Dr. Khan to disturb peace and tranquillity between the speech in December and his detention in February. The inevitable inference is that the NSA was invoked only to avoid releasing him following the Chief Judicial Magistrate court?s order granting him bail. The process to invoke the NSA itself began only after the bail order, the Bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Saumitra Dayal Singh noted.

The use of stringent national security laws against political dissenters, in the absence of any appeal to violence, is something to be condemned in all cases. However, there is something perverse about the resort to preventive detention just to frustrate bail orders. In particular, the authorities have shown excessive zeal in dealing with Dr. Khan. In 2017, he was arrested on charges of negligence and corruption even though circumstances indicated his strenuous efforts to ensure continuous oxygen supply. He spent months in prison before an inquiry absolved him of the charges of negligence and corruption, but was found to have been engaging in private practice. The paediatrician?s suspension is yet to be revoked. Even though the verdict gives him relief, it comes after he spent seven months in jail. And his case will some day go to trial. The case of Dr. Khan is poor advertisement for India?s democratic credentials, for it brings to light its propensity to criminalise dissent, single out individuals for persecution and display a general disregard for basic rights.",Dissent and detention: On Dr. Kafeel Khan,The Hindu,
74,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"The Allahabad High Court?s order quashing the detention of outspoken Dr Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act was a slap on the face of the UP administration that had him imprisoned for months. While the local district magistrate (DM) Chandra Bhushan Singh invoked the NSA citing a ?provocative? speech Dr Khan delivered at the Bab-e-Syed gate of the Aligarh Muslim University against the Citizenship Amendment Act last year, the court found nothing objectionable in the address.

Instead, the Bench said the speech actually gave a call for national integrity. It hauled the DM over the coals for his selective reading of the address, ignoring its true intent. The administration used every dilatory tactic, the Bench pointed out, like providing radiograms of the extension of his detention under the NSA without giving him a hard copy of the order that would have enabled him to seek judicial redress.

Besides, to satisfy the Constitutional mandate that a detenue must be provided adequate material to seek relief at the earliest, Dr Khan was given a compact disk of his AMU speech but without an instrument to play it! Neither was he given a copy of the speech?s transcript. The NSA was invoked against him by the DM in February, days after a local court granted him bail following his arrest in late December at the Mumbai airport.

Incidentally, the court?s decision came a day before the Union Cabinet cleared an ambitious plan to reform the bureaucracy and build capacity to make government employees ?more creative, proactive, professional and technology-enabled?. But would that training reform the likes of the Aligarh DM, who clearly had an axe to grind against Dr Khan? Politicisation of the bureaucracy is the elephant in the room.

Reforms that sidestep political meddling cannot fully repair the nation?s steel frame, which is how Sardar Patel had described the civil services. The DM apparently invoked the NSA because people can be detained under it without charges for up to 12 months. His abuse of the draconian law reignited the debate on whether it should exist at all in a progressive democracy. After all the opprobrium, the UP government ought to take action against the DM; else it could be accused of being his instigator.",Dr Kafeel Khan case a litmus test for bureaucratic reform,The times of India,
75,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"At a time that the Supreme Court is being seen as a muzzled watchdog silent in the face of rampant rise in hate crimes and unconscionable negligence, it is the high courts that have emerged as a beacon, offering limited succour to the persecuted. This time around, it has come to the rescue of two brave citizens.

Allahabad high court chief justice Govind Mathur has to his credit a long line of recent orders upholding fundamental rights. Many of them have come in suo motu cases.

 

It was Justice Mathur?s bench, for instance, which directed the Uttar Pradesh government in March this year to remove hoardings erected at public places displaying photos and addresses of alleged Citizenship (Amendment) Act dissenters.

And it is his bench that ordered the release of Gorakhpur paediatrician Kafeel Khan, setting aside the Yogi Adityanath government?s detention order against him, declaring his speech at Aligarh Muslim University campus on December 13, 2019, a call to unity and national integration.

Most importantly, it ruled the invocation of the National Security Act in the case two full months later as unsustainable. Khan had been granted bail in February but was kept in jail under the provisions of the NSA.

However, anti-CAA activist Devangana Kalita, who was granted bail by Delhi high court judge Suresh Kumar Kait who ruled that her presence in the protests at Jafrabad Metro station on the night of February 22 failed to prove that she had instigated Muslim women to violence or given a hate speech, will continue to remain in jail. She is in custody under another FIR filed under the draconian UAPA and has been refused bail in that case.

In his speech at AMU, Khan, whose family has been made the target of miscreant attacks, had called attention to the appalling absence of doctors and basic infrastructure in heartlands, and he had also mentioned that as a member of his community he refused to be browbeaten into silence.

He had criticised the impunity with which a labourer was killed in Rajasthan in 2017, simply for being Muslim.

In February, Khan?s own uncle became the victim of a shooting. The courts should compensate Khan for the sufferings that he has endured and the months that he has spent in jail ? in 2017, too, he was harassed by the same administration for exposing medical negligence. A rational and pluralistic polity should heed his views.
",A whistleblower?s vindication,The Asian age,
76,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"The Allahabad High Court has done well to set aside the detention of Kafeel Khan, a doctor at Gorakhpur?s BRD Medical College and Hospital, under the National Security Act and order the UP government to release him ?forthwith?. Khan has been in jail for nearly seven months, after the NSA was slapped on him for delivering an allegedly ?provocative speech? at a protest by students against the discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens in Aligarh Muslim University in December last year. The High Court said the speech was ?a call for national integrity and unity?, and did not mirror ?any effort to promote hatred or violence?. The two-judge bench described the doctor?s detention under NSA, imposed two months after the speech was delivered, as ?bad? in law, and based on ?selective reading and selective mention of few phrases from the speech ignoring its true intent?. A complete reading of the speech does not disclose any effort to promote hatred or violence, the Court said.

Clearly, due process was violated in Khan?s arrest, in the subsequent slapping of the NSA, and his extended detention. Unfortunately, this is part of a building pattern ? of draconian laws being mis-used by the state to cramp the citizen?s right to free speech and dissent, even as a quiescent court mostly looks on, or away. In Kedar Nath Singh, 1962, the Supreme Court had ruled that incitement to public disorder or violence was key to judging a speech as seditious. Yet, in recent times, state authorities have frequently invoked the provision to criminalise free speech and clamp down on dissent, with the judiciary, especially the lower courts, more often than not giving the state the benefit of doubt and delay. This newspaper has scrutinised 10 cases involving free speech that came before the Supreme Court since January this year and found that in four of those cases, in which the court upheld the right to free speech or gave relief, the state and the petitioner had argued on the same side ? that is, the court gave no relief to the petitioner in the other six cases where the Centre was the defendant and objected.

The Allahabad HC deserves credit for breaking this disquieting pattern. Its order provides a template for other courts to follow in cases that involve the fundamental rights of citizens and their encroachment by a state armed with repressive and outdated laws. This is especially crucial in times when the spaces for dissent are seen to be imperilled and in need of protection.
",Releasing Kafeel Khan,The Indian Express,
77,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"If individuals have been deprived of months and years of their life for no justifiable reason at all, restitution of some sort must be provided. While lost time cannot be returned, and harassment cannot be undone, at the very least, compensation can mitigate some of the harm caused.On September 1, the High Court (HC) of Allahabad passed an order declaring that Dr Kafeel Khan had been wrongly detained by the Uttar Pradesh government, under the National Security Act of 1980. The 42-page order of the court makes for damning reading. It points out that Khan was deprived of the material on the basis of which he could have made representations against his detention; on substance, Khan?s 23-minute speech in Aligarh on December 12, 2019, which formed the basis of his detention, had been misrepresented by the police; taken as a whole, the speech was in support of national unity and peace, instead of seeking to undermine public order or create disunity. Furthermore, Khan had been detained on February 13, 2020 ? a good two months after the speech ? thus implying that there was, at best, a tenuous connection between his intention and any genuine apprehension that he would cause public disorder.

As the HC judgment makes clear, the State had no case that justified keeping Khan in preventive detention, and depriving him of his liberty. In fact, the circumstances ? Khan was served a preventive detention order immediately after he had been granted bail in another case ? strongly suggest that this was vindictive State action. While the eventual judgment setting him at liberty is, therefore, to be welcomed, it is important to remember that at the time of his release, Khan had spent months in jail, all under the stated goal of ?preventing? future crime, and without a trial.

In this respect, however, Khan?s case is not unique or isolated. Earlier this year, the Jammu and Kashmir HC found that many detention orders that had been issued after the effective nullification of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, had no merit at all, and deserved to be quashed. Once again, these orders came after the detainees had already spent many months in prison.
",India needs a law to compensate the wrongly-imprisoned,The Hindustan Times,
78,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"Allahabad High Court on Tuesday quashed the detention of Dr Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act (NSA) and ordered his immediate release, saying the Uttar Pradesh government had done a ?selective reading? of his anti-CAA speech at Aligarh Muslim University.

The medical doctor had called for national integrity and not incited violence, the court observed.

Khan, a critic of the BJP governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh, has been in jail since January.

Although he was granted bail in February, the Aligarh district magistrate invoked the stringent NSA against him with the ratification of the Uttar Pradesh government and continued to keep him in jail.

On Tuesday, quashing Khan?s detention order, the bench of Chief Justice Govind Marhur and Justice Saumitra Dayal Singh said: ?A complete reading of the speech prima facie does not disclose any effort to promote hatred or violence. It also nowhere threatens peace and tranquillity of the city of Aligarh. The address gives a call for national integrity and unity among the citizens. The speech also deprecates any kind of violence. It appears that the district magistrate had selective reading and selective mention for few phrases from the speech ignoring its true intent.?

The court was hearing a writ petition filed by Khan?s mother Nuzhat Parveen challenging the doctor?s detention against the NSA. Parveen had initially moved the Supreme Court, which transferred the case to Allahabad High Court.

Khan had addressed students at AMU on December 12 last year during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The court noted that he had been arrested on the charges of ?provoking religious sentiments? and attempting to ?incite hatred, enmity and disharmony? to cause an ?adverse impact on the harmony between the communities? and disturb public peace.

The high court said Khan?s detention under the NSA after being granted bail by a competent court in February was illegal. A person can be held without trial for 12 months under the NSA. Khan is lodged in Mathura jail.

Allahabad High Court said that a ?causal link is found to be missing or completely broken? in the case.

?In the absence of any material indicating that the detainee continued to act in a manner prejudicial to public order from December 12, 2019, up to February 13, 2020 (when Khan was booked under the NSA), or that he committed any such? further act as may have had that effect, the preventive detention order cannot be sustained,? the court said.

The court added: ?In fact, the grounds of detention are silent as to public order at Aligarh being at risk of any prejudice in February 2020 on account of the offending act attributed to the detainee on the date December 12, 2019.

?What remains is a mere apprehension expressed by the detaining authority without supporting material on which such apprehension may be founded.?

The court noted that Khan had during the AMU speech said that ?Mota Bhai? ? elder brother in Gujarati and a term sometimes used to refer to Amit Shah and Narendra Modi ? wanted to see people either as Hindu or Muslim, that crores would be spent to send people to detention centres and that the healthcare system had broken down. The court noted that Khan had said ?they talk about shamshaan-kabristan, Ali-Bajrang Bali, your Kashmir, Ram Mandir, CAB, NRC. They don?t talk about the promise that they made for 2 crore jobs per year. They don?t talk about giving Rs 15 lakh to us as earlier said by them. The economy is doomed, small businessmen are ruined.?

Explaining why Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath had targeted him, Khan had said: ?The talk about nationalism is actually pseudo-nationalism, on the basis of pseudo-Hinduism only.?

The court said Khan was given a compact disk containing his speech at AMU for him to prepare his representation but no player was made available.

?The grounds for detention along with material were supplied to the detainee in light of Clause (5) of Article 22 of the Constitution, enabling him to submit his representation to the competent authorities at the earliest. The material so given was a compact disk of the speech delivered by Dr Kafeel Khan on 12th December, 2019, at Bab-e-Syed gate of Aligarh Muslim University. On asking, it is conveyed to us that no transcript of the speech was supplied to the detainee. The non-supply of transcript would have been of no consequence if a device would have been supplied to the detainee to play the compact disk. It is the position admitted that no such device was made available to the detainee,? the court noted.

The court observed that the orders extending Khan?s detention were never given to him. ?The record shown to us and the pleadings of the petition also refer that only radiograms relating to the decision of the state government for extension of the term of detention were supplied to the detainee,? it said. ?The radiograms mention that the actual order shall be sent through speed post but in fact nothing except the radiograms were given to the detainee.?

The court added: ?In light of the discussion above, we are having no hesitation in concluding that neither the detention of Dr Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act, 1980, nor the extension of the detention are sustainable in the eye of law,? it said.

The Uttar Pradesh government had in August extended Khan?s detention under the NSA by three months, saying that an advisory council had noted in its report that there were ?enough reasons? to keep him in jail.

?The order of detention dated 13th February, 2020, passed by the district magistrate, Aligarh, and confirmed by the state of Uttar Pradesh is set aside. The extension of the period of detention of? Dr Kafeel Khan is also declared illegal. A writ in the nature of habeas corpus is hereby issued to release Dr Kafeel Khan? from State custody forthwith,? the court said on Tuesday.

Khan had earlier been arrested in 2017 following the deaths of children at Gorakhpur?s Baba Raghav Das Medical College because of lack of oxygen cylinders. Khan had been the nodal officer of the 100-bed encephalitis ward of the medical college. It later emerged that the company that had been assigned to ensure uninterrupted supply of liquid oxygen had disrupted delivery because of non-payment of dues by the state government. Khan and nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital had been arrested and later granted bail.

An Uttar Pradesh government committee had later absolved Khan of any wrongdoing. The doctor had then alleged that chief minister Adityanath did not like him because he had spoken the truth about the case.

79,,"HYDERABAD: Immediately after TRS swept the civic elections in Telangana on Saturday, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao told reporters at the party headquarters that his government would pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the state assembly. This would make Telangana the fourth state to pass such a resolution after Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan.

He also revived talk of a federal front and said both the Congress and BJP had failed the country.

""It may not happen immediately, but I believe that the front will form the next government at the Centre."" He added that he supported abrogation of Article 370 and opposed the CAA in the interest of the nation. TRS had voted against CAA in Parliament.

Stressing that CAA was ""100% a big mistake"", he said that he would mobilise support of like-minded regional party leaders and the 15-odd chief ministers, who are against CAA, and hold a conference in Hyderabad soon. ""If required a public meeting with 10 lakh people will be organized in the city,"" he added.

KCR also said that in his view, the Supreme Court should take up CAA suo moto and scrap it. ""I request the prime ministers to withdraw CAA as it is against the preamble of the Constitution,"" he said. ""The image of our country is at stake globally.""

""Instead of focussing on the important issues like recession, literacy and poverty, the government was raking up the Hindu-Muslim issue,"" he said. ""Is it good if you send Muslims out of the country? What happens if Hindus living in outside India are asked to leave? Besides, BJP is already losing one states after another. It lost Jharkhand recently and reports indicate that AAP may win Delhi,"" the chief minister said.

The TRS supremo blamed the Centre for the economic slowdown in the country. ""Economists have been expressing concern over the recession and millions of people have lost their jobs. The states too were suffering because of the economic slowdown.""

He added that the NDA government has not released Rs 34,000 crore to states towards GST relief and other devolution of funds. ""The state government is yet to release Rs 1,131 crore and another Rs 2,812 crore towards IGST. I will write a letter to the Prime Minister to release the amount apart from sending a delegation to New Delhi to build pressure on the Centre,"" the CM said.",,,

Gorakhpur:

The maternal uncle of Dr Kafeel Khan, who was recently arrested for allegedly making inflammatory statements during anti-Citizenship Law protests, was shot dead in front of his house at Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur, police said on Sunday.

Dr Nusratullah Warsi aka Dada, 55, a property dealer, was shot dead on Saturday night at around 10:45 pm and an FIR against two people was filed after a written complaint of his family. He was returning from his lawyer's house, a few metres away from his own, when a man shot him in his head, killing him on the spot.

Police said it appears to be a case of murder due to monetary and property dispute and they are searching for both the accused. Three teams have been constituted to investigate the case.

""On the written complaint of family members, case of murder against one Imammuddin and Anil Sonkar has been registered and police has initiated probe and is searching for both the accused. Police met the women in their house and is interrogating them,"" Circle Officer VP Singh said.

Dr Kafeel Khan, suspended doctor of Gorakhpur BRD Medical College, was last month arrested under charges of giving a provocative speech during a protest against the CAA and NRC at Aligarh Muslim University and was later charged with the National Security Act (NSA).

Dr Kafeel Khan had last month raised apprehension in a Mumbai court about being killed in an ""encounter"" by the Uttar Pradesh police after claiming that he had been ""falsely"" implicated in the case by them.

The paediatrician had come to the limelight in 2017 when a controversy broke out after the death of over 60 children in less than a week at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, where he was posted.

Arvind Kejriwal today thanked the people of Delhi for ensuring their ""son"" returns as Chief Minister of the national capital for a third time. After taking oath at the historic Ramlila Maidan today, Mr Kejriwal addressed thousands of people, who cheered for him as he started speaking.

""Your son has taken the oath of Chief Minister for a third time. This is not my win, this is your victory. This is the victory of every Delhi wala, every mother, every sister, every youth, every student, every family in Delhi,"" Mr Kejriwal said.

""In the last five years we have tried to work on how to ensure every family can become happier, give some relief in their lives, how to develop Delhi fast... In the next five years our effort on this will go on,"" he said.

""Everyone, call your villages and tell them 'our son has become Chief Minister, there is no need to worry',"" the Chief Minister said, drawing applause from the crowd.

The Aam Aadmi Party won 62 seats in the Delhi assembly election - a near repeat of its 2015 tally of 67 seats at the end of one of the most polarising campaigns in the backdrop of the anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protests.

The national capital has a large population of people from all walks of life who have come from outside the city. Mr Kejriwal's message today that they should ""call home"" to tell their ""son"" is the Chief Minister is being seen as his acknowledgement of their support.

""Some people voted AAP, some voted for BJP, some for Congress, but when I took oath as Chief Minister, I am the Chief Minister of everyone, of AAP, BJP, Congress and other parties. I have never been biased against anyone, have never said 'I won't help you because you voted for BJP'. I will work for everyone. In areas in the city where the BJP is strong, I have put water pipes, improved roads,"" Mr Kejriwal said.

In 2015 too, Mr Kejriwal's oath-taking ceremony took place at the Ramlila Maidan. It was held on February 14, coinciding with Valentine's Day. In 2013 after his party's first poll victory, the swearing-in ceremony was again held at the same venue.

Despite international pressure, the government will continue to stand by its decision to revoke Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and introduce the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Sunday.

He said the country had ""awaited"" these decisions for many years. ""In national interest, these decisions were necessary,"" Mr. Modi said at an event in his parliamentary constituency Varanasi.

""Aur duniyabhar ke sare dawaabo ke bawajood, in faislo par hum kayam hai aur kayam rahenge [Despite the various international pressures, we stand by these decisions and will continue to stand by them,"" Mr. Modi said. The country was now taking decisions that were always left behind in the past, he added.

The Prime Minister's tough talk assumed significance in view of protests against the CAA in various parts of the country.

In Varanasi, Mr. Modi launched projects worth 1,250 crore. He unveiled the statue of Deendayal Upadhyay, which, at 63 feet, is the largest statue of the leader in the country, as per the government. The Prime Minister also dedicated to the nation the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Memorial Centre.

Mr. Modi flagged off the third corporate train, Mahakaal Express, which links three Jyotirling pilgrim centres -- Varanasi, Ujjain and Omkareshwar.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Modi attended the closing ceremony of the centenary celebration of Jagadguru Vishwaradhya Gurukul at Jangamwadi Mutt and released the translated version of 'Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth' in 19 languages. He also launched the 'Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth' mobile app.

Citing certain key decisions of his government, Mr. Modi referred to the trust set up for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and said it would work ""rapidly.""

He said that after setting up of the trust, the work on the construction of 'Ram dham' would start fast and added that his government had also decided to transfer 67 acres of land to the trust.

He also inaugurated a 430-bed superspeciality government hospital.

Mr. Modi said that in the past few years, 25,000 crore worth developmental projects had either been completed or were going on at a fast pace in Varanasi.

Roadway, highway, waterway and railway had been given top priority by the government and the Purvanchal Expressway work was going on at fast speed in Uttar Pradesh.

84,,"GUWAHATI: A local court on Monday extended by four days the police remand of JNU student Sharjeel Imam who was arrested on charges of sedition and brought to the state last week.

Imam was brought to Assam from New Delhi on February 20 and produced in ourt which had initially sent him to four days' police remand, they said.

Upon the expiry of his police remand, he was on Monday produced before the Kamrup (Metro) Chief Judicial Magistrate.

The student, who came into the limelight during the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, was arrested from Bihar's Jehanabad on January 28 for allegedly making inflammatory speeches at the Jamia Millia Islamia University and in Aligarh.

Imam was slapped with a sedition case after his speeches went viral on social media wherein he was heard allegedly speaking about Assam's possible secession from the country in the wake of the CAA.

A case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) has been registered against him in Assam.

On February 18, the Delhi Police had named Imam as an ""instigator"" in its charge sheet filed against 17 people in a case related to violence during protests against the CAA at New Friends Colony near Jamia Millia Islamia last year.

Meanwhile, Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the state government is keeping a tab on the developments related to Imam's interrogation.

85,,"Hyderabad: The NDA government has not defined whether the USD 5 trillion dollars economy it aims to achieve is real GDP or nominal, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said on Saturday and claimed real GDP would not touch the figure at the current growth level by 2024 or 2025.

Chidambaram, who spoke on the Union Budget at a meeting organised by the party here, hit out at the government for allegedly proving to be incompetent in managing the economy. ""Firstly, the Modi government has still not defined whether 5 trillion dollars is real GDP or nominal.

Secondly, while Modi keeps on saying 2024, the economic survey, in the introduction, the goalpost has been shifted from 2024 to 2025. Be that as it may, at the current level of growth, real GDP will not touch 5 trillion dollars either by 2024 or 2025,"" the former Finance minister said.

Chidambaram was replying to a query on the government's ambitious target of USD 5 trillion economy. Interacting with the audience, he said the NDA government should not ""clutter"" the tax structure by seeking to introduce separate systems, one giving exemptions and other not.

Asked by a member of the audience whether there is a possibility of the government withdrawing various tax exemptions leading to the common man not having options to save money and tax, he felt that there was still confusion within the government on the matter.

""Even if all the income tax payers opt for the new system, the maximum benefit will be Rs 40,000 crore.What is Rs 40,000 crore when India's GDP is almost 2.7 trilllion dollars,"" he said. The impact would be so minimal that it won't make a big difference, he claimed.

Noting that the IT exemptions are savings, he said their withdrawal would lead to a decline in the savings habit which is not good for the country. ""More than anything else, I don't think the tax structure should be cluttered like this. You don't have anywhere a tax structure, system A, system B, system A for exemptions...Without exemptions.

I think it is cluttering up tax system. I would not have done it. The sooner they clarify what their intention is, the better,"" he said.

On the proposed disinvestment in LIC, he said there was no clarity whether the government would list or disinvest the insurance behemoth. ""Without clarity about whether they are listing or disinvesting. I cannot comment on it. But on LIC, unless they convince me why they want to disinvest, our present position is we are deeply suspicious of their motives to disinvest LIC,"" he said.

Chidambaram, who lashed out at the Union Budget for allegedly failing to lead the economy on the path of progress and job creation, alleged that the Modi government was like a helpless doctor who failed to diagnose the illness of a patient and treat him effectively.

""Altogether, the bottomline is we have a patient who is extremely ill. Doctor has proved himself incompetent. Diagnosis of the doctor is hopelessly wrong,"" he said.

People who diagnosed the illness correctly like Dr Arvind Subramanian, former Chief Economic Adviser, were allowed to go from the government, he said.""Not having diagnosed the illness of the patient, the doctor is helpless. The least the doctor can do is to say...I am sorry.

We made mistake, will Dr Manmohan Singh come and advise us,"" he said.

Asked whether it is true that the country spends one per cent GDP to keep 950,000 troops in Kashmir, he said there were more troops there than necessary. ""I think we are keeping many, many more troops in Kashmir than I would ever accept as necessary. I think it is wrong. We should thin out our troops deployment in Kashmir.

More than that, I think we should give back the freedom to the people of the Kashmir valley,"" Chidambaram said.

Slamming the Centre for invoking the Public Safety Act against former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah to keep them in detention for upto a further two years, he said ""there cannot be a greater outrage, a greater assault on liberty than what they have done.

I think all of us should collectively pray for that the freedom of the people of Kashmir, the 75 lakh people of Kashmir valley, is restored,"" he added.",,,

To ease congestion due to protests at Shaheen Bagh, the UP Police reopened the road leading from Kalindi Kunj towards Faridabad. The stretch from Noida's Mahamaya flyover to Delhi and Faridabad has been reopened, sources in the UP Police said.

The Shaheen Bagh-Kalindi Kunj road in southeast Delhi has been blocked for over two months due to ongoing protests against CAA.

88,,"NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal, engineer, civil servant and Delhi's man with a development agenda, is the David who slayed the mighty Goliath for the second time in five years.

The Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party is poised to win 63 of Delhi's 70 seats, leaving the BJP with seven and decimating the Congress, overcoming the BJP's divisive campaign.

Nine years ago, Kejriwal slipped into the political frame behind Anna Hazare during the Lokpal movement in 2011 before quickly enlarging his canvas, first as a satyagrah activist and then as founder of the cleverly named Aam Aadmi Party that took on the might of the BJP to reclaim Delhi for a third time on Tuesday.

The name of his party as carefully chosen as his public persona perhaps, Delhi's 51-year-old chief minister is the embodiment of the everyday man but one who has tailored his politics and campaign in keeping with the times.

As he emerged on the victory stage to loud cheers from his AAP supporters and shouted ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"", ""Inquilab Zindabad"" and ""Vande Mataram"" before saying ""I love you"" to Delhiites, many remembered the earnest activist who went on a hunger strike for a Lokpal bill in 2011.

The year after, in 2012, he started his political party and emerged as a mascot of an alternative brand of politics - and the 'aam aadmi' politician with his muffler casually wrapped around his neck, and sometimes his head, oversized shirts and open toed sandals.

Though his ambitions to make the AAP a national party have not met with much success, the Delhi chief minister's hat is one that will stay -- for the next five years at least.

His effort to be seen as a direct challenger to Narendra Modi came a cropper in 2014 when he contested the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi. He tried to make an electoral dent in Punjab and Goa in 2017 but that didn't work either. So Delhi it is for the moment.

In 2013, he became chief minister but only for 49 days, images of him sleeping in his utilitarian Wagon R while on 'dharna' for a Jan Lokpal (ombudsman) wrapped in a cotton quilt against the cold winter nights making the front pages.

Battling allegations of being autocratic and unyielding in his politics, Kejriwal resigned soon after, only to bide his time till 2015 when he scripted a stunning win to bag 67 of Delhi's 70 seats.

Earning the moniker 'mufflerman' for his fondness for the muffler, Kejriwal runs his party with the proverbial iron fist and has learnt to temper his aggression, say people close to him.

Notwithstanding the electoral triumph for BJP in the May Lok Sabha polls, the IIT graduate has managed to anchor a campaign that wooed all sections in the city.

He announced in the beginning of the campaign that he will run a positive campaign fought on the basis of his government's development work in the last five years.

His main poll planks were schemes such as free bus travel for women in DTC buses, free 200 units of electricity, installation of 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras and free 20,000 litres of water.

During the election campaign, Kejriwal attacked BJP on several occasions, asking who is their chief ministerial candidate.

He was careful, however, to not speak out too clearly on the anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh, the centrepiece of the BJP's campaign.

He was called a ""terrorist"" by BJP leaders, but Kejriwal hit back saying voters could back the BJP if they thought so or opt for his party if they view him as a son of Delhi.

Born on August 16, 1968 in Hisar in Haryana to Gobind Ram Kejriwal and Gita Devi, Kejriwal is a man of simple tastes.

His family is always by his side.

Kejriwal, who lives with his parents, wife Sunita and two children, is often seen going out for a quiet meal or the occasional film. Both daughter Harshita and son Pulkit are IIT products.

On Tuesday, the self confessed film buff and fond husband told his cheering supporters from the victory dais that it was Sunita's birthday.

A strict vegetarian who prefers home-made food, Kejriwal is married to Sunita, who is also an Indian Revenue Service officer and his batchmate. He is known to be an ardent practitioner of Vipassana, and seldom misses his yoga and meditation sessions.

The Ramon Magsaysay award winner was part of Team Anna that also included India's first IPS officer and now Puducherry governor Kiran Bedi and lawyer Prashant Bhushan.

He was the civil society representative member of the committee constituted by the government to draft the Jan Lokpal bill, following the campaign for introduction of the anti-graft legislation.

Kejriwal did a degree in Mechanical Engineering graduate from IIT Kharagpur.

He joined Tata Steel in 1989 and, after working for three years, resigned in 1992 to take up the Union Public Service Commission examination which he cleared to become an IRS officer. He also worked with Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata.

Kejriwal worked with people in slums through an NGO called Parivartan he set up with his confidant Manish Sisodia.

His efforts towards the enactment of the RTI Act to empower the poorest citizens of India won him the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership in 2006.

In February 2006, after resigning as joint commissioner in the Income Tax Department, he became a full-time activist and started another NGO, Public Cause Research Foundation, with his award money as a corpus fund.

Will this man with many accomplishments manage to break out of Delhi to extend his political reach to other parts of the country?

That's the challenge facing the AAP today.",,,
89,,"Buried in countless discussions on the failure of hate campaign against Shaheen Bagh and the victory of the Aam Aadmi Party's politics of ""kaam"" has been the actual role of the women of Shaheen Bagh. The Union Home Minister's exhortation to deliver ""electric current"" to Shaheen Bagh, the chanting of ""goli maro"" and the actual attacks by stray shooters, crafting sedition charges against individuals, have contrasted singularly with the pictures of rows of women sitting with children, waving the flag and copies of the Constitution and most of all, dedicated to peaceful protest. The importance of this cannot be underestimated.

Speaking at a panel on the results of the Delhi elections on a television channel, Seshadri Chari, a senior BJP spokesperson, described the communally vituperative campaign of his party as ""not hate politics but strategy"". This is a chilling statement. The problem, however, is not only its questionable morality - an important if not scary issue - but the failure of the strategy.

Clearly, as strategy, it has had its uses. The BJP vote share in the 2020 Delhi elections has been reasonable enough. But it failed to produce a cutting edge precisely because the strategy did not extend beyond the rhetoric of incitement. It was the deliberate commitment to peaceful protest by the women satyagrahis - ordinary mothers, homemakers, youth - that staved off any violent counter-response. Counterfactually speaking, if there had been the slightest hint of violent response, the spiral of violence and communal polarisation would have been uncontrollable. The strategy of hate would then have been unstoppable. It would have upended the politics of ""kaam"".

It may be recalled that the women have carried on despite no acts of solidarity from AAP; instead, they have continuously faced the fear of violent ejection by the police. It is the silent contribution of the Shaheen Bagh women that remains unremarked upon in the high-decibel commentaries on the election results.

It raises a difficult question for the BJP now. It deliberately nationalised the elections. Beginning with the Prime Minister, organised and co-ordinated by the Home Minister and deploying a phalanx of Chief Ministers and over 200 MPs, the BJP campaign has been one of the most communal vituperative ever in the history of India's elections. It has raised questions of national integrity, portraying Shaheen Bagh as a centre of terrorist and anti-national activity - and then going on to associate this unpleasing fiction with AAP. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself has been accused of being a terrorist. The basic elements of this campaign are by no means new. Over time, any opposition to the BJP has been progressively labelled as anti-national. This has provided a momentum of aggression to BJP's nationwide campaigns.

For BJP, Shaheeh Bagh was the testing ground of a new use of communal mobilisation. Within less than a year of its massive general election victory and the apparent success of its strategy of dismembering the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP government has faced the strongest-ever protest that has spread across the entire country on the issue of the CAA-NRC. Most importantly these protests were carried out by the youth of different communities, becoming a platform for voicing dissatisfaction against a governance perceived to be high-handed, regulative of lifestyles and unable to provide jobs.

The Delhi elections provided an opportunity to begin a counter-initiative by the BJP. The BJP-ruled States had put down the protests with an iron hand.

Shaheen Bagh provided an opportunity to initiate an ideological counter-offensive against the protests. Indissociable from the protests against the CAA-NRC which it had given birth to, Shaheen Bagh could be deployed to isolate, marginalise and communalise the protests. The only problem - which finally defeated the BJP strategy - was that it was dominated by women who refused to be provoked.

The unresponsiveness of these women was complemented by the careful distancing of the AAP from the protesters. Both of these put BJP out on a limb. More importantly, it allowed the focus to be put on a positive element, that is, the work done by AAP. If Shaheen Bagh dominated the saffron air waves, it was kaam that was discussed among the ordinary voters on the ground. The laying out of water and sewage pipes, free bus rides to women, the rise of standards in government schools and so on, dominated the agenda. It became so effective that the ground campaigners of the BJP had to take recourse to questioning the wisdom of providing ""freebies"" to the electorate. In short, BJP workers were caught in the self-defeating position of saying that the electorate was unfit for the welfare measures that they have traditionally expected the state to provide.

Where does the BJP go from here? Can it afford to charge with all the vituperation and aggression at its command, like Don Quixote against windmills that refuse to move? For BJP aggressive polarisation has been important for both electoral victory while combining this with establishing the affective and ideological foundations of a future Hindu Rashtra. But if communal polarisation does not work as an issue, what else will the BJP have in its electoral kitty? Delhi has shown that a purely negative campaign of discrediting the agenda of its rivals will not do. Nor can it step back now, for the reputation of its Shah-Modi leadership has been built on its authoritarian stubbornness to defend its positions. There is too much now at stake for the BJP leadership and too little ammunition at its disposal.",,,

Analysts have said the BJP's turn to divisive rhetoric is an attempt to consolidate Hindus in an election where it was widely perceived to start with a disadvantage because of the AAP's contention of providing better governance.

The BJP also does not have a CM face against the incumbent, Arvind Kejriwal, and is fighting the election in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Harish Khurana, a spokesperson of the BJP's Delhi unit and son of former chief minister Madan Lal Khurana, defended the union minister, saying that it was the crowd that uttered the inciteful words and not Thakur.

""If you see the video, Thakur did not even say the words. So, in a way, he should not be held responsible. The slogan was not invented by him; it has lasted for years,"" said Khurana.

The Election Commission didn't buy the argument to play down the minister's role.

A BJP?candidate Kapil Mishra, too, have whipped up hateful speeches. Mishra was pulled up by the Election Commission for inciteful comments such as ""Delhi mein chhote chhote Pakistan bane"", ""Shaheen Bagh mein Pak ki entry"", etc. The election commission gagged him for 48 hours and an FIR was filed against him.

Khurana, however, said that the hate exists on both sides. ""More than about being right or wrong, one must see who started it. There were slogans of 'Jinnah-wali azaadi' at Shaheen Bagh. BJP leaders were told that they need to take permission to enter Shaheen Bagh, not to mention the inconvenience that has been caused to people,"" said Khurana.",,,

As the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) Sunday morning shut down the entry and exit of the Jaffrabad station in Northeast Delhi after protesters against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) gathered around the station, BJP leader Kapil Mishra said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was right in calling the Shaheen Bagh protest ""an experiment.""

""Stage is being set up in Jaffrabad. Another area where the law of India will not be followed. Modi ji rightly said that Shaheen Bagh was an experiment. Be ready for road blockage, streets, markets, neighborhoods will also be blocked one by one. Keep quiet till they do not knock on your door,"" Mishra wrote on Twitter attaching a video of a stage being constructed.

Prime Minister Modi, at an election rally in Delhi earlier this month, had said that the protests against CAA in Shaheen Bagh is not a coincidence, but an experiment by the Opposition parties to disturb the peaceful environment in the national capital. Mishra, who was the BJP candidate from Model Town, lost badly in the just concluded Delhi election.

The protest at Jaffrabad caught the police unaware Saturday night when about 500 people, mostly women, gathered there to protest against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and blocked a major road.

On Sunday, Delhi Police deployed additional personnel around the Jaffrabad metro station area as women continued their protest against the CAA. There was already heavy security deployment, including women police personnel, in the area when the protest began Saturday night.

The women, carrying the national tricolour and raising slogans of 'aazadi', said they would not move from the site till the Centre revoked Citizenship (Amendment) Act, PTI had reported. They also tied a blue band on their arm and also raised 'Jai Bhim' slogans.

The women had blocked road No. 66 which connects Seelampur to Maujpur and Yamuna Vihar. Another protest against the CAA is already on near the main Seelampur road and Kardampuri.

The protest at Jaffrabad began even as efforts are on to clear a road blocked by anti-CAA and anti-NRC protesters at Shaheen Bagh in Southeast Delhi for over two months.

The protesters have blocked the road connecting Southeast Delhi and Noida. The Supreme Court has appointed mediators to find a way to end the impasse.

Protesters say the CAA which fast tracks citizenship for illegal non-Muslim migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh is unconstitutional, divisive and discriminatory because it makes religion a test of citizenship.",,,

BJP president J P Nadda on Thursday said by bringing in the Citizenship Amendment Act Narendra Modi had implemented what Mahatma Gandhi and the previous prime ministers merely talked about.

Addressing a rally in Himachal Pradesh's Solan, Nadda called Modi a ""world leader"", citing also the praise he got from US President Donald Trump during his recent India visit.

Nadda claimed that Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Manmohan Singh talked about bringing minorities persecuted in the neighbouring countries to India.

""They merely said so but Modi did so,"" he said.

The population of minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan has reduced drastically, he said, claiming that many of their members have converted.

The new law fast-tracks Indian citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis who left these countries before 2015 due to religious persecution.

Nadda accused opposition parties of misleading people on the amended citizenship law.

Beginning a two-day trip to Himachal Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party leader claimed that Donald Trump praised India and Modi for 20 minutes out of his 28-minute speech at the Motera cricket stadium in Gujarat.

Nadda described Modi as a ""world leader"".

He said the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 will strengthen the region.

""India has become one country constitutionally under Modi's leadership,"" he said.

He referred to the last block development council elections, saying they were held without a single drop of blood being shed.

The BJP president said a delimitation exercise in Jammu and Kashmir would now enable reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha and the Vidhan Sabha for the Gujjar-Bakarwal community.

Accusing other political parties of ""parivarvad"", he said, ""No one can stop the BJP from growing further as it is the only party which is based on ideology. This is the only party which keeps on introspecting."" ""We know who will be next president of the Congress, NCP, SP, BSP, Telugu Desam and YSR Congress. But the BJP is the only party where nobody knows who will be the next chief,"" he said.

The tweet comes on the day AAP swept the Delhi assembly polls with confirmed wins or leads on about 62 out of the 70-seats in the assembly. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also won his New Delhi seat with over 20,000 votes.

""The family of two crore Delhi residents have declared that their son Arvind Kejriwal is not a terrorist but a patriot. We bow before the great people of Delhi,"" said the tweet.

BJP leader and MP Parvesh Verma was gagged by the election commission for likening Kejriwal to a terrorist during the election campaign.

""If Kejriwal comes to power again, Madipur's streets will become Shaheen Bagh. There are many Natwarlals (cheats) like Kejriwal and 'aatankwadis' (terrorists) like Kejriwal hiding in Delhi. We have to throw them out. I fail to understand if we should fight terrorists in Kashmir or against terrorists like Kejriwal in Delhi,"" Verma had said.

AAP milked Verma's onslaught and launched a counter-campaign alleging the remark was an insult to Delhi's ""son"" and that the people of the capital will give a befitting reply to the BJP for calling him a traitor.

Mishra defected to the BJP from the ruling party in 2019 and even campaigned for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.

The Congress' Arvinder Singh Lovely, who also contested unsuccessfully against Mr. Gambhir, is trailing in the Gandhi Nagar constituency. Mr. Lovely, who was a Minister in the Sheila Dikshit government, had jumped ship to the BJP in 2015, only to rejoin the Congress in 2018, calling himself an ""ideological misfit"" in the saffron party.

Former Chandni Chowk MLA Alka Lamba, who rejoined the Congress in 2019, has barely over 3,400 votes, as against the AAP's Parlad Sawhney's 45,800-odd vote count.

One of the AAP's youngest leaders Raghav Chadha, who is contesting from Rajinder Nagar, has won. Mr. Chadha campaigned for the seat by reminding people that he is a ""local boy"" who grew up in the area.

AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj is also leading in Greater Kailash constituency with a margin of over 16,000 votes. The AAP candidate had earlier beaten the BJP's Ajay Kumar Malhotra and Rakesh Guliya in 2013 and 2015, respectively, with huge margins.",,,

She slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that when the entire nation was bothered about the GDP and the economic crisis, Mr Modi has only two agendas: Shaheen Bagh and Pakistan. ""I am proud of the Shaheen Bagh women who have become the face of resistance against the rise of fascism"".

Reiterating her concern that despite repeated condemnation of violence against women, Ms. Karat said that crimes against women were at an all-time high with one rape occurring every 90 minutes in India.

Accusing Home Minister Amit Shah of the alleged misuse of the Delhi police, Ms. Karat said that Mr. Shah and the BJP leaders used all means to win Delhi elections but they failed.

99,,"The Pulwama suicide car bombing, for which the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group owned responsibility, was the deadliest single attack in 30 years of insurgency in Kashmir.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers who died in the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir a year ago to the day on Friday, as the Congress and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) engaged in a political slugfest.

""Tributes to the brave martyrs who lost their lives in the gruesome Pulwama attack last year. They were exceptional individuals who devoted their lives to serving and protecting our nation. India will never forget their martyrdom,"" Modi wrote in a Twitter post.

The CRPF joined the prime minister in recalling the victims of the attack, in which a man drove an explosives-laden car into a truck carrying the troopers in Pulwama. ""We pay our heartfelt tribute to all the martyrs. CRPF is a brave fighting force on the federal grid and remains undeterred by any untoward incident,"" CRPF director general AP Maheshwari, said.

The Pulwama suicide car bombing, for which the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group owned responsibility, was the deadliest single attack in 30 years of insurgency in Kashmir. It heightened tensions in the subcontinent, and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. On February 26, 2019, the Indian Air Force (IAF) bombed a Jaish terrorist camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan, followed by a dogfight the following day over the Line of Control in Kashmir.

The Congress raised questions about the attack and the inquiry into it, and asked why the report on it was not being made public.It has previously alleged that the BJP had tried to gain political and electoral mileage out of the Balakot strikes by the IAF.

""Today as we remember our 40 CRPF martyrs in the #PulwamaAttack, let us ask: 1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack?"" former Congress president Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the entire nation paid homage to the martyrs of Pulwama; still, many questions remain about the attack.

""Why is the report of Pulwama attack not being made public? Who is accountable? Who brought the 350 Kgs IED? Why were intelligence reports of attack ignored?"" he tweeted. IED is short for improvised explosive device.

The BJP was quick to hit back, with minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy accusing Gandhi of insulting security forces. ""Did surgical strike or airstrike ever take place under the Congress rule? For the first time, Pakistan is afraid of us. Rahul Gandhi has insulted security forces by commenting on them,"" he said.

And, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said Gandhi had chosen to target not just the government but even the security forces at a time when the nation was paying tributes to those killed in the Pulwama attack.

""When nation is paying homage to martyrs of dastardly Pulwama attack, Rahul Gandhi, a known sympathizer of LeT & Jaish-e-Mohammed, chooses to target not just the government but security forces as well. Rahul will never question real culprit, Pakistan. Shame on you Rahul,"" tweeted Narasimha Rao.

Even the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), questioned the government about the inquiry report on the attack and demanded accountability, accusing the BJP of seeking votes in the name of the CRPF personnel killed in the attack. ""Where is the Inquiry report one year on after the terror attack? Who has been held accountable for the loss of so many lives and the massive intelligence failure?"" CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said.

Separately, the CRPF said on Friday that the families of all its personnel who died in Pulwama had been paid dues ranging from ~2-3 crore and were getting the last pay drawn as monthly pension, except one over which a case is pending in the courts because of questions over who the legal heir is.

The victims were honoured on Friday with a memorial at the Lethpora camp of the force, close to the location of last year's attack, in a solemn and emotive ceremony. The memorial is inscribed with the names of all the 40 troopers along with their photographs and the motto of the Central Reserve Police Force -- 'Seva and Nishtha' (Service and Loyalty).

Maharashtra's Umesh Gopinath, who undertook a 61,000 km journey to meet the families of the 40 troopers, collected soil from their homes in an urn and presented it to the CRPF at the ceremony.",,,

But it also signalled that it could not approve a protest that would go on indefinitely at the same location. The bench said the protests could continue but it should be done in an area ""designated for protests"".

""You cannot block a public road indefinitely. If everybody starts protesting everywhere, then what will happen,"" the bench led by Justice Kaul said.

The top court had last week put off hearing two petitions filed against the protests in south Delhi in light of the assembly elections held on February 8. The bench had then indicated that it recognised that there was a problem and intended to examine how to resolve it.

But at the same time, the judges were conscious that it did not want its decision to impact elections in the national capital. ""Why should we influence it?"" the bench had responded last week on a request for a decision before the Delhi election.

Shaheen Bagh has become the epicentre of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which empowers the government to fast-track the grant of Indian citizenship to so-called persecuted minorities from the Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The law has been criticised by many because of its exclusionary nature. It is also feared that it will be used in tandem with a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The government has clarified that there was no decision to implement a nationwide NRC though it has spoken of plans in parliament and outside that the register is imminent.

The petition complains that the road closure at Shaheen Bagh causes great inconvenience to the public and leads to wastage of precious time, energy and fuel besides overburdening the Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway, Akshardham and Ashram routes.

The Kalindi Kunj road, Sahni argued, is a vital route since it connects three states -- Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana -- and the road closure has led to huge difficulties not only for the residents of the area but hundreds of thousands of commuters who are not able to use the road because of the blockade.

Launching a scathing attack on the Congress ahead of the coming gram panchayat elections, State BJP president and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said here on Monday that the grand old party was facing intellectual bankruptcy and it was fomenting violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the country.

Addressing party workers at a function organised to install the new office-bearers of Dakshina Kannada unit of the party, Mr. Kateel said that the Congress had become irrelevant as it had lost the confidence of people in the country.

He said that dynasty politics, craving for power, corruption and compromising with its grand old principles proved too costly for the party that it could not win enough seats to get recognised as an Opposition party during the last year's Lok Sabha election.

Mr. Kateel said that the 135-year-old Congress was being headed by an interim president, Sonia Gandhi, now. The Congress could not get a president appointed to its Karnataka unit. Ever since the era of Jawaharlal Nehru, the Congress is still following dynasty leadership.

""How can a party (Congress) which is facing a leadership crisis both at the national and State levels can lead the country?"" Mr. Kateel asked.

""Political power in the Congress was vested with its Ministers and MLAs. But in the BJP, the power is vested with its party workers,"" he said.

Mr. Kateel said that the BJP would and should continue its party worker-centric approach.

Otherwise, it would have to face the same situation like the Congress was facing now, he added.

The BJP State president said that the Congress was indulging in negative campaigning on the CAA in the country by instigating protesters.

He said that Mahatma Gandhi wanted to give Indian citizenship to minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The Congress leader, late Indira Gandhi, too wanted it. But the Congress of today could not make the aspirations of its own leaders a reality.

He cited an incident of a Congress leader, who raised the slogan in the neighboring country to take a jibe at the ruling party.

Addressing a poll rally in Jangpura, Gandhi said that the Congress candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah, who is contesting the election on the party's ticket went to Pakistan in 1987 and raised the ""Hindustan Zindabad"" (Long live India).

""The BJP leaders talk about patriotism. Show me just one BJP leader who raised 'Hindustan zindabad' slogan in Pakistan. Congress' Jangpura candidate (Tarvinder Singh Marwah) did that and he went to jail for it,"" he said.

""They [BJP] talk about the Hindu dharm, they talk about Islam, they talk of Sikhism. They have no knowledge of religions. In Hiduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism -- where is it written that attack other people, suppress them?"" he asked the crowd.

What kind of ""Hindu dharm"" is this of Mr. Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as Hinduism talked about taking everyone along, Mr. Gandhi said at the rally organised in favour of the Congress candidate from Jangpura, Tarwinder Singh Marwah.

""Show one BJP leader who raised the 'Hindustan Zindabad' slogan in Pakistan. Congress's Jangpura candidate did that and went to jail in Pakistan for it,"" he said.",,,

BJP national general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao on Thursday challenged DMK president M.K. Stalin to a debate on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Addressing mediapersons in Coimbatore, he said that the debate could take place ""in any village"" of Mr. Stalin's choice ""in the next 20 days.""

""We are going to challenge DMK in every village,"" he asserted. Claiming that no Indian Muslims would be affected by the contentious Act, Mr. Rao urged Mr. Stalin to explain the reasons the DMK is opposing the CAA. He accused the DMK of ""demanding citizenship"" for the Muslims of Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Rohingyas of Myanmar.

Mr. Rao said that the BJP would conduct conferences, public meetings and door-to-door campaigns in support of CAA in Tamil Nadu. He also welcomed those who have recently supported the CAA, including actor Rajinikanth.

Mr. Rao also welcomed the setting up of an autonomous trust, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, which was announced on Wednesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. Mr. Rao questioned the DMK as to why the party has not welcomed the construction of Ram temple yet.

He dismissed allegations of a rift in the AIADMK-BJP alliance in the State. The new BJP president for Tamil Nadu will be announced after the Delhi elections, Mr. Rao added.

Senior BJP leaders Pon. Radhakrishnan and C.P. Radhakrishnan were present.",,,
109,,"Images of bloody communal violence have scarred Delhi. The violence comes barely weeks after a shrill and polarised election campaign in which anti-CAA protesters became the target of incendiary rhetoric by top politicians. When politicians described protesters as ""desh ke gaddar"" (traitors) the message was clear: there would be no reach out, instead, there would be confrontation. When leaders preach violence, they give permission to footsoldiers and street confrontation is precisely what has happened, pitting Hindu against Muslim.

The politics of confrontation is not limited to Delhi. In Bengaluru a young citizen has been slapped with sedition charges simply for chanting a slogan. According to a Crime in India report, sedition cases were slapped 156 times during 2016-18. Since the anti-CAA protests began in December, 194 people have been charged with sedition. When governments repeatedly slap sedition on citizens a chilling warning is sent out.

Politicians have become confused about the meaning of democracy. They equate democracy with an electoral majority. But majoritarianism is not democracy which means, above all, respect for debate and dissent. Today's governing party could be tomorrow's governed, which is why by restraining the coercive power of the state through watchdog institutions, democracy protects the smallest minority - the free individual. Majoritarianism, on the other hand, inevitably leads to an abuse of the state apparatus because majoritarian regimes cannot tolerate anyone not part of the ""majority"" which is in office.

It's intriguing that it's fallen upon the higher judiciary to send emissaries to the public agitation in Shaheen Bagh. The role of such interlocution ordinarily should fall on the government which is best placed to offer solutions. But the Modi government either ignores Shaheen Bagh or demonises it, ruling out dialogue. In fact the Modi government consistently avoids the principal forum for dialogue, namely Parliament, thus grossly devaluing discussion and debate.

The fact that the establishment has not been able to offer any kind of structured interaction for a protest that has been going on for two months, shows the government prefers wielding force over face-to-face interaction. This is dangerous.

When governments refuse to dialogue, the result is a slide into violence on both sides. India's state is already a highly coercive one, and if the threat of state violence is used against protests, this not only normalises violence but also blurs the lines between law and crime on the ground. In the process, moderates are squeezed out and space is created for goons of every stripe to enter the fray. This is evident from the armed ruffians prowling the streets of Delhi, emboldened by governing parties' violent speech.

In Kashmir too, where there should be dialogue, there is instead a deafening void. Three CMs are in detention on questionable grounds. The longest internet shutdown in a democracy is depriving millions of access to services and information. The best the government has been able to do is send some EU representatives for shikhara rides and a group of BJP ministers to meet carefully vetted ""Kashmiri people"". In sharp contrast, former PM Vajpayee (also from BJP) and home minister Advani held several rounds of talks even with the separatist Hurriyat Conference.

The Big State is using strong arm tactics across India. In Bidar, Karnataka, authorities chose to slap sedition cases on parents and teachers because of a junior school play rather than hold talks with school authorities for a resolution of the controversy. When historian Ramachandra Guha was whisked away in a police van it showed that aggressive state power doesn't spare even distinguised scholars.

In Lucknow's ghanta ghar, where a Shaheen Bagh like protest is ongoing, police swooped down in a show of armed might and arrested over 100 women. In Chennai, another anti-CAA protest at Washermanpet locality has been lathicharged and barred from taking out a procession. During Delhi's election campaign the governing BJP sought to muzzle and delegitimise its rivals by calling them ""terrorists"" who speak the language of Pakistan. Using the high perch of state power to cast political rivals as national enemies and terrorists, legitimises violence in society as a whole.

Gandhi warned constantly of the inherent violence of an expanding state. When a government begins to use police power to coerce citizens to its agenda, we have the makings of a police state. The police then becomes a partisan political player, always on the side of governing politicians against the citizen.

Why is dialogue crucial in a healthy democracy? Because peaceful and voluntary exchange of ideas and products lies at the heart not only of a successful society but also of a growing economy. Citizens who want to protect their freedoms and liberties need to be utterly intolerant of violence either by the state or by private actors. By refusing to engage in peaceful exchange with those who are opposing it, governments themselves encourage the cult of violence.

The question may be asked, whether the previous UPA government went too far in attempting to dialogue with its opponents, surrendering executive space. Did the UPA outsource decision-making to NGOs and anti-corruption movements and allow itself to be fatally weakened? The sight of top ministers going to the airport to receive Baba Ramdev at the height of the Anna Hazare agitation was seen as a feeble government meekly capitulating before challengers.

Yet from an enfeebled UPA, we now seem slowly but inexorably moving to the other extreme: an authoritarian state that criminalises dissent and replaces dialogue with the danda. Remember, the Indian police are still governed by an antiquated 19th century law that made them a 'standing army' of the colonial raj. Is that the role we expect them to play in a modern republic?",,,
110,,"MADIKERI/HUBBALLI: A day after Karnataka agriculture minister BC Patil sought a law that enables authorities ""to shoot at sight"" those chanting pro-Pakistan slogans, Madikeri MLA Appachu Ranjan (BJP) echoed his words on Monday. After inaugurating a new building at Somwarpet Government Primary School, Ranjan said: ""Shoot down people who raise pro-Pakistan slogans.""

Amid these developments, fresh trouble brewed elsewhere in the state when the walls of a government higher primary school on the outskirts of Hubballi in Karnataka were on Monday morning found scribbled with 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans. Villagers staged a protest and demanded that the miscreants be promptly arrested.

The statements by the minister and the MLA come in the wake of pro-Pakistan slogans raised by Amulya Leona Noronha, 19, during an anti-CAA event in Bengaluru last week.

Ranjan told the students: ""Every citizen must protect and preserve the nation's rich culture. However, many are involved in anti-national activities. These people are using resources, including food and water, provided by our country and then raising slogans against the nation. Such people must be shot down immediately. They must be exiled and sent to Pakistan. No advocate must fight their cases in court.""",,,
111,,"At least 40 CRPF jawans were killed after the convoy of 78 buses, in which around 2,500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar, came under attack in February last year.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi raised three questioned as he paid tributes to the martyrs of Pulwama attack.

""Today as we remember our 40 CRPF martyrs in the #PulwamaAttack , let us ask: 1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack?"" Gandhi said on Twitter on Friday.

Gandhi had initially expressed solidarity with the government and the security forces after the attack in February last year. ""The entire Opposition stands united with the security forces and the government,"" Gandhi had said in the aftermath of the attack.

But in subsequent months, as Lok Sabha election drew near, he stepped campaign against the prime minister and the BJP-led NDA government's policy to deal with terrorism.

India is marking the first anniversary of the Pulwama attack, the deadliest in decades on security forces in the region, by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) on February 14, 2019.

At least 40 CRPF jawans were killed after the convoy of 78 buses, in which around 2,500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar, in the attack.

Following the dastardly attack, India launched extensive diplomatic efforts to get Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar designated as a global terrorist, which finally became a reality on May 1 last year when China lifted its technical hold on a proposal introduced by the US, the UK, and France in the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council.

Around 12 days after the terror attack, in the wee hours of February 26, Indian Air Force (IAF) jets bombed the JeM camp in Balakot, in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The decision to carry out air strikes was taken within 24 hours of the Pulwama attack, with the government giving the Air Force two weeks to select terror targets and launch air strikes against them, three people familiar with the planning of the mission said, asking not to be named. The Balakot strikes are a classified operation.",,,
112,,"NEW DELHI: The BJP is plagued with a chronic inability to translate its votes into seats in Delhi.

For the sixth consecutive time, BJP's vote share in Delhi assembly elections has hovered in the 30s with 38.51% votes. However, the same consistency was found to be missing in the number of seats won by the saffron party. It could win a mere 8 seats in the 70-seat assembly.

So much so there were 57 constituencies, in comparison to AAP's 34, where BJP received more votes in 2020 than 2015. However, BJP yet again failed to break the jinx of Delhi.

Despite enjoying consistent support in the national capital, the number of seats, won by BJP in the last six assembly polls, have fluctuated from one extreme to another. It won a maximum of 34 seats in 2013 polls and a minimum of 3 seats in 2015.

In 1998 assembly polls, though it secured 34.02% votes, BJP lost to Sheila Dikshit-led Congress party. It seats plummeting to 15 seats from a previous high of 49 seats.

Even at the peak of the popularity of Dikshit government in Delhi, the party was able to keep its vote share intact -- 35.22% (2003) and 36.34% (2008). Once again the BJP failed to translate its vote share into seats and could win 20 (2003) and 23 (2008) seats.

In 2013, in the backdrop of the Modi wave, BJP secured its biggest victory in Delhi by securing 34 seats -- one seat short of the majority. Once again the party received one-third of the total votes polled. Surprisingly, the vote share of 33% was less than the previous election in 2008 when it had secured 36.34% votes.

In 2015, the party suffered its worst defeat. Yet its support base remained intact at 32.3%.

BJP and its consistent support base in Delhi

The reason behind BJP's consistent performance with the voters in Delhi, and not the seats, lies in India's history of partition, according to Biswajit Mohanty associate professor in the department of political science, Deshbandhu College, Delhi.

A city of migrants, Delhi's demography underwent a serious change following the partition when millions of refugees streamed into the city from Pakistan and settled in the dozens of refugee colonies built to rehabilitate them. The refugee families blamed the Congress for their plight and supported Jan Sangh, a party that is believed to have understood the sentiment of the migrant community. Since then the saffron party has occupied a soft soft for the refugees living in these colonies.

Later, the BJP -- to gain the Hindu votes, especially of the erstwhile poor refugees and now prosperous Punjabi Hindus -- aligned actively with the RSS in Delhi. As a result it came to represent the rich class, a section of the educated middle class and upper caste people.

""The urban rich, upper caste and middle class Hindus remained the stable base of the BJP, whose number in Delhi can be roughly estimated between 30 to 40%,"" Mohanty said.

On the other hand, the Congress, termed as the catch-all party, was favoured choice of the poor, lower middle class and Muslims. These groups formed a major portion of the population in Delhi and hence was able to defeat BJP despite it enjoying the support of the urban rich, upper caste and middle class Hindus.

Why BJP can't convert its votes into seats

From its inception, Delhi has been witnessing bi-party politics -- BJP versus Congress till 2013 and then BJP versus AAP from 2015 onwards.

""The BJP could not do better in the most of the earlier elections even in the state elections where the congress would always begin with a 35% advantage with the Muslim and underprivileged support base,"" Mohnaty added.

Since 2013 the role of the Congress has been taken over by the Aam Aadmi Party in the national capital. The ever growing population of the economic migrants in Delhi from other states has also helped AAP to strengthen its base.

""The poor, lower class and upper caste votes had already become the support base of the AAP, a dj vu of the Congress politics in the initial phase of 1990s in Delhi, the addition of the middle class became an added advantage. It is because of AAP's vote share crossed more than 50 per cent with all the sections supporting it, the BJP's vote share could not be converted into the seats across Delhi,"" Mohanty said.",,,
113,,"Aziz Qureshi, former Governor, calls the act the 'mischief of an employee'.

Madhya Pradesh Urdu Academy Chairman Aziz Qureshi said that the removal of portraits of President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi from his office - just the night before he took charge - was intended to stoke a controversy and was the handiwork of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), seeking to derail efforts at course correction at the literary institute.

""It was all a planned conspiracy. It was the mischief of an employee who allegedly removed the portraits for the purpose of cleaning them,"" Mr. Qureshi, former Congressman and Governor, told The Hindu. He denied the charge that the portraits were removed by the employee to mark protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Stating that in the past 15 years, the former BJP government in the State had ""destroyed"" the academy here, he claimed it often pressured employees to march in lockstep. ""They dissolved the working committee and the general body, and used funds for political purposes. This won't be allowed anymore,"" he said.

In March 2016, allegations regarding the academy's 'saffronisation' came to the fore when Urdu poet Manzar Bhopali accused the secretary of it, who then filed a criminal defamation suit in return. He had in the past also written to former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan alleging corruption in the State-run body.

""The academy was a dream of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and I was among the advocates of it. The Chair is an opportunity for me to promote Urdu. It will function purely as a non-political, literary body. Irrespective of ideologies, students with merit can step inside it,"" said Mr. Qureshi, who took charge on January 24.

On the morning of Januray 31, former BJP MLA Surendra Nath Singh led party workers to the Academy, where they raised slogans against the State government, and submitted portraits of Mr. Modi and Mr. Kovind. Mr. Qureshi alleged the workers asked the staff, predominantly Muslim, to go to Pakistan.

Denying the charge, Mr. Singh said, ""It's a government-run institution, and both Mr. Modi and Mr. Kovind hold Constitutional posts. When there are portraits of others, why not have theirs too?""

Though the Election Commission of India has prohibited the display of portraits of the Prime Minister in government offices, it hasn't done so for the President. Still, in 2017, the former BJP government in Madhya Pradesh made it mandatory to display portraits of the Chief Minister along with the Prime Minister in all government offices, an order still in force.

The employee, against whom the police have registered an FIR on complaint from Mr. Qureshi, claimed he was being made a scapegoat to settle the issue. ""The portraits have been there for more than a year, and dusting them before a new official joins is regular practice. When I took down the portraits someone took photographs and circulated them. This is affecting me and my family mentally and socially,"" he said while requesting anonymity.

""I have never taken part in a protest. With a case charged against me now, there's a blot on my life,"" said the employee for 30 years, in response to the allegation that his removal of portraits came as an act of protest against the CAA.

Meanwhile, Deepak Vidrohi, a lawyer, and former student of the academy said the language was wrongly associated with one community -- Muslims -- who became easy targets. ""Any language can't be looked through the prism of religion or community. It is continuously evolving. Language is region-specific and not religion-specific.""",,,
114,,"They demand an end to communal politics, ask Centre to revoke CAA or clear doubts about the law

Eleven days into a sit-in demonstration, on the lines of the protest at Shaheen Bagh, women protesters at Hauz Rani on Monday appealed to political leaders to not politicise the demonstrations ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Delhi.

Demanding that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act be revoked, protesters asked why the right to free speech is reserved only for politicians and not for those seeking constitutional rights.

Zainab Mallick, a homemaker, said: ""From [Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister] Yogi Adityanath to Delhi MPs, everyone seems to be making controversial statements pertaining to Shaheen Bagh and the Muslim community. The ones firing shots are hailed as 'desh bhakts' but we are raising the flag and are being called 'anti-nationals'. What kind of logic is this?"" Stating that the CAA is ""clearly snatching rights from the Muslims"", the 25-year-old, added: ""We are pained with the constant vilification of the Muslims. Why are we being treated like this? Instead of talking about the economy, women's safety and education, all that is being talked about is Pakistan. Why should we go there? Jinko jaana tha wo chalein gaye [The ones who had to go are already gone].""

The protest at Gandhi Park saw a stream of visitors, with women taking turns to occupy a tent accompanied by their toddlers.

Samreen, (23), also a homemaker, said: ""Stop playing politics in our name. If you [Centre] say that there are rumours about the CAA then why don't you come and clear our doubts? We brought you to power and now just because we are questioning you, we are being called 'anti-nationals'. If the police are with the Centre then where will we get the bullets from? What narrative are you trying to spread and why should we even support this law?""

With a toddler in tow, Ms. Samreen added: ""Education and economy in the country is in a bad shape. Instead of talking about real issues why spew hate? Yahan pe kaam chalega jumla nahi [Work matters here and not gimmicks].""

Taira, (60), who is a regular at the demonstration, said: ""We are here for our demands not for anything related to the elections. While some are dragging Arvind Kejriwal into the issue, others are talking about the BJP. All we want is our rights.""

Adding that the protesters are trying to ""speak to the Centre and not the Delhi government"", Ms. Mallick added, ""Our concern is with the ones who brought in this law in the first place. So it does not matter whether Mr. Kejriwal is supporting us or not. We want the Centre to hear us. It is high time that politics over the Hindu-Muslim dichotomy ends.""",,,
115,,"Bengaluru: Actor Naseeruddin Shah late Friday evening made a surprise appearance at Bilal Bagh, Bengaluru's Shaheen Bagh where women are on indefinite dharna against Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. He said women protesting in similar spaces across the country have given him the courage to speak up about all that's wrong with the country.

Thousands of women thronged the shamiyana at the protest venue to catch a glimpse of Shah, who arrived around 9pm. They applauded his remarks attacking critics of the anti-CAA protest.

""These brave women are being asked by some that how can they come out on the streets. Have the men sent them to protest? Who gave them permission? And to them, I have only one thing to say: These brave women are awakened now and don't need anyone's approval,"" Shah said to the roaring applause from the all-woman gathering.

""When students in Jamia Millia Islamia are attacked, when a nine-year-old girl in Bidar is traumatised and is forced to live alone because her mother is taken into custody on no grounds and when in Delhi's Gargi College, miscreants enter the premises and misbehave with our daughters, people who have spoken about 'beti-padao beti-bachao' seem to have still not found a voice to speak out,"" Shah said, adding the incidents left his blood boiling.

""But women like you in Shaheen Bagh and Bilal Bagh help me find courage and peace of mind,"" he said. Shah stayed at the venue for around 15 minutes and organisers had a tough time escorting him out due to the huge crowd.

Earlier in the day, independent Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani assured the protesters that he would take their message of peace and resistance to Delhi's Shaheen Bagh and everywhere else where similar protests are under way.

""...I bring you the message of the sisters protesting at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh and Patna's Sabzi Bagh that 'we all are determined, you too remain firm in your resistance and we promise victory will be ours',"" Mevani told the women whose protest entered the seventh day on Friday.

Mevani said whenever someone asks him why protests like Shaheen Bagh are cropping up everywhere in the country and why do so many people go there, he answers: ""Whoever has a conscience will go to Shaheen Bagh, Bilal Bagh and the likes. Those who place their belief in Manusmriti will build detention centres and those who place it in the Constitution will come to Shaheen Bagh.""

""I know you are full of enthusiasm but do remember to keep the slogans of Jai Shri Ram' and 'Nare Taqbeer' in your hearts and homes. Because this is not a Hindu vs Muslim or India vs Pakistan fight. It's BJP vs the entire India,"" he said.",,,
116,,"New Delhi: ""Kaam to kiya hai"". That's the refrain about AAP this correspondent kept hearing on a daylong whistle-stop tour across swathes of south Delhi from Govindpuri to the Cantonment. The tone varies -- those openly declaring that they'll vote for 'jhaadu' say it with pride, while for self-declared BJP and Congress supporters, it is a grudging acknowledgement. 

Judging by this sample of a few dozen people in one part of the capital, Arvind Kejriwal's strategy of making what his government has delivered the sole plank of the election campaign appears to be paying off. In contrast, BJP's high-decibel pitch on Shaheen Bagh, CAA, the 'tukde tukde gang' and so on may not quite be yielding electoral dividends. Most people felt the anti-CAA protests were wrong, but said this had little to do with Delhi polls. 

Many of those spoken to also made it clear that they had voted for Modi (it's the PM whose name is mentioned, not his party's) in 2019 and would do so again in the Lok Sabha polls, but were just as clear that Kejriwal was their choice for running Delhi. Congress as a party is seen by most as not even in the contest, though individual candidates do seem to be in the fray in specific constituencies. 

So what is this ""kaam"" that keeps coming up in discussions? Some elements are predictable -- electricity and water bills being reduced or eliminated, or bus rides being made free for women, for instance. But, as more than one person pointed out, these are concrete, measurable gains. The amounts varied depending on which economic strata one spoke to. Some said they were saving from Rs 1,500 to 2,000 a month from the subsidies and freebies, others even as much as Rs 4,500. 

But at least as important as these quantifiable gains is the perception of government schools being improved. A group of elders in Hauz Rani, both Muslims and Hindus, waxed eloquent about the local school. Some of them had their children studying in private schools. If the improvements continued, they said, they would consider shifting their kids to the neighbourhood government school. 

Health is another area where the government is seen as having made a difference -- and not necessarily through mohalla clinics. Vicky, a fruit seller in Malviya Nagar who makes it clear he will vote for BJP, nods in acknowledgement as a tender coconut seller beside him holds forth on how the government hospital in the locality has been beefed up. Medicines, once hard to come by at the hospital, are now more often than not available, he admits. And, if the hospital is unable to treat you, the doctors put that down in writing and the government foots the bill for your treatment even in corporate hospitals, he adds in amazement. Whether or not this actually works quite so smoothly, the perception is telling. 

Roads, sewage lines and hand pumps being installed also figure in this discourse on 'kaam'. The perception that AAP MLAs are accessible and you can get to them without going through middlemen doesn't hurt either, though this could be specific to the constituencies visited. 

The young are particularly focused on ""development"". ""Unemployment is the main issue for us. You have lived the best of your life, but ours still lies ahead,"" says Nadeem, who seems in his early 20s. Without jobs, the best and most educated of our generation are forced to do ghulami (slavery) in foreign countries. This is what we need to fix instead of wasting time on frivolous issues."" 

Parampreet Singh, who runs a furnishings shop in Kalkaji, has a similar take: ""Look around the world. Have any of the developed countries got where they have by obsessing about religion? On the other hand, look at places like Pakistan or Afghanistan. Do we want to become like them?""",,,

The college student, identified as Amulya Leona, has been charged with sedition, provoking enmity between groups, and intentional insult to provoke breach of peace, said Deputy Commissioner of Police Ramesh Bannoth.

It was just after Mr. Owaisi's arrival on the stage at Freedom Park here that the 19-year-old student was asked to speak. After preliminary remarks, she suddenly shouted ""Pakistan zindabad"" thrice, leaving the crowd and organisers stunned.

Some of the organisers rushed to her and tried to take the mike away and stop her from speaking further. Mr. Owaisi too joined in. Holding on to the mike, the girl then went on to shout ""Hindustan zindabad"" twice, before a posse of police personnel and organisers whisked her away from the stage.

Soon after the student was taken away, a visibly upset Mr. Owaisi told the crowd: ""Whatever has been spoken [by the girl] is wrong. Neither my party nor I has any connection with it. As long as we are alive, we will be raising Bharat zindabad slogans. Never had we any relationship with Pakistan nor will we have anything in future,"" he announced.

He further stated: ""This is condemnable. The organisers should not have invited such people to this place. If I had known that these kind of things would be said here, I would not have come here.""

It is unfortunate that the organisers have invited such people and a wrong message is going out, he said.

""Now, BJP has got an opportunity and will blame me,"" he added.

Every speaker, who took the podium after the incident, condemned the pro-Pakistan slogans raised by Amulya.

Janata Dal (S) councillor representing Gurappanapalya, Imran Pasha, one of the organisers of the protest under ""Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isayi Federation"", claimed that they had not invited the ""activist"" and were not aware that she would be speaking from the stage. Mr. Pasha said that such statements were ""a deliberate attempt to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims"".

Meanwhile, the BJP State unit tweeted, ""Truth is that protests against CAA are a joint venture between Pakistan and anti-National forces led by INC India.""

He later took to Twitter to explain what patriotism meant for him.

""Heartiest thanks Delhi for respecting five years of work, for respecting education. Being in government and providing quality education is real patriotism"".

The Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra, a cultural centre reflecting India's connect with its diaspora, was on Thursday renamed Sushma Swaraj Bhavan in honour of the late External Affairs Minister known for her empathy in reaching out to distressed Indians globally.

The Foreign Service Institute, a renowned institution where diplomats are trained, has also been renamed as Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service.

The government's decision to name the two institutions after Sushma Swaraj came a day before her 68th birth anniversary.

The illustrious leader who brought rare empathy and a human approach to India's diplomacy as External Affairs Minister in the previous Narendra Modi government died on August 6 last year following a massive cardiac arrest.

The Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, said the two institutions have been renamed in solemn tribute to the ""invaluable contribution"" of Sushma Swaraj to Indian diplomacy, the cause of the Indian diaspora and the ethos of public service.

""The announcement is being made on the eve of her birth anniversary falling on February 14 in honour of the legacy and decades of public service of the former External Affairs Minister,"" it said.

As External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj brought a sense of assertiveness in India's diplomacy besides engaging the diaspora, a central focus of the country's foreign policy priorities.

She was one of the most followed foreign ministers on Twitter globally. She was known for helping Indians stuck abroad as she was quick to respond to their calls for help on Twitter. She even became popular in Pakistan for her response to people wanting to get visas for medical treatment in India.

The Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra located in the heart of the Capital was set up to recognise the contributions of the overseas Indian community to India's growth and development.

A museum in the Kendra depicts the history of migration of the overseas Indian community as well as their experiences and contributions.

She had many firsts to her credit - the youngest Cabinet Minister in the Haryana government, the first woman Chief Minister of Delhi and the first woman spokesperson for a national political party in the country.

She was Information and Broadcasting Minister in the 13-day Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1996 and got the Cabinet portfolio again after he led the BJP to power in 1998. Long seen as a protege of veteran BJP leader L.K. Advani, she also was the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha between 2009-14.

120,,"NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday said the Delhi assembly election is a clear contest between patriots under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and people who oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act and support Shaheen Bagh.

Speaking at a public meeting organised in support of Master Azad Singh, the Mundka BJP candidate and brother of former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma, Shah said, ""Desh par jo ungli uthayega, usko munh tod jawaab Narendra Modi sarkar degi (Whoever points a finger at the nation, the Modi government will give a resounding answer to them).""

""When people of Delhi go to vote, they should keep in mind that this election is between two ideologies. On one side are Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal, who do appeasement politics for vote bank and are with Shaheen Bagh. On the other, there is BJP under PM Modi, which is a group of patriots who want to ensure the development and security of Delhi and the country,"" Shah added.

Promising to remove Lal Dora and development in unauthorised colonies once voted to power, the BJP star campaigner said, ""Modiji has a plan ready for these colonies. But we need to be in power in the state to make it a reality. In Delhi, people living in jhuggis will get two-room flats built under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. There will be paved roads, streetlights, proper drainage, gardens and libraries. But for that we need a BJP government in Delhi.""

""We will give scooters to poor college-going girls, bicycles to primary and secondary school girl students and flour to poor at Rs 1 per kg up to 5kg per person. We don't make false promises. We say it and we do it. Our government is going to form in Delhi and I assure you that both the central and state governments are going to make Delhi the best capital in the world,"" the home minister said.

Shah also addressed meetings at Sadar Bazar, Rajendra Nagar and Chirag Dilli and attended a roadshow at Karol Bagh. At Sadar Bazar, he assured that CAA was not meant to take anyone's citizenship.

""These people (Congress and AAP) instigated our Muslim brothers and sisters that your citizenship will go away. I have said this many times. Citizenship will be given to refugees under CAA, not taken away from anyone. These people (refugees) have as much right here as you or me. You tell me whether we should give them citizenship or not,"" Shah said, stressing on the fact that in Delhi, one-third of the people are refugees from Pakistan.

In his memoir 'Let Me Say It Now' released on Monday, Maria who helmed the investigation in 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, claimed that the LeT had planned to project the attack as a case of ""Hindu terror"" and Pakistani terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Kasab was to die as Bengaluru's Samir Chaudhari.

Taking on the Congress over the claim, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said that for the first time in the history of Islamic terrorism the perpetrators have attempted to mislead people about their identity.

""This raises serious questions, if the saffron terror plot was the combined project of the Congress and Pakistan's spy agency ISI. Around the same time, the UPA coined the saffron terror tag and Rahul Gandhi told US diplomats that India's homegrown groups are a greater threat to the country then Islamic terror groups,"" he said.

Rao alleged that Rahul Gandhi's comments seemed to have joint sponsorship of terror groups across the Line of Control and added that Kasab's fake ID proof and fake claims of the Congress not just have a coincidental resonance but also seem to be part of a larger conspiracy.

He demanded answers from the Congress, saying the party should come clean on this and should clarify whether ISI was also extended part of the Congress-led UPA.",,,

The ruling party's retort came almost immediately after Gandhi, while paying homage to the 40 slain CRPF personnel killed in the attack, asked who benefitted the most from the attack and what was the outcome of the inquiry into it.

""Today as we remember our 40 CRPF martyrs in the Pulwama attack, let us ask: 1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack? (sic)"" he asked in a tweet.

BJP spokespersons slammed Gandhi for his remark, alleging that it insulted those killed in the attack.

BJP's outspoken Bairia MLA Surendra Singh has described the ongoing anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi as a global conspiracy by Muslim countries to ""divide the country"".

124,,"In the first state elections of the new decade, whose outcome will be known on Tuesday, incumbent chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in the face of a strong challenge mounted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

After being witness to a fierce election campaign, nearly 14.79 million registered voters in Delhi will finally get an opportunity to vote on Saturday to choose representatives to 70 assembly segments across the national capital and decide who governs the city-state for the next five years.

In the first state elections of the new decade, whose outcome will be known on Tuesday, incumbent chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in the face of a strong challenge mounted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has sought votes in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The first is the AAP's attempt to replicate its success of the 2015 assembly election -- when it won 67 of the 70 seats -- versus the BJP's effort to replicate its success in the 2019 Lok Sabha election,when it won all seven parliamentary seats in Delhi. The second is the AAP's campaign, which is focused on local governance issues and its track record in the past five years versus the BJP's, which focused on the larger ideological issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, national security, and an effort to project all protesters -- and the AAP -- as ""anti-national"". The third is an effort by the AAP to carve out a multi-religious and multi-class alliance versus the BJP's campaign to consolidate Hindu voters across regions, castes and classes. And the fourth is the question of leadership -- where the CM is not pitted against a local rival but the PM.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said the primary issue in the election will be the work done by his government, but hit out at the rival BJP for trying to change the discourse and make it ""about a Hindu vs Muslim"" issue. ""Ours is the first government in 70 years that is seeking votes entirely on the ground of work done on the development front,"" he told HT in an interview on Wednesday. People have to decide whether they ""opt for the politics of abuse and violence, or politics of development"", he added.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said his party's agenda was development. ""We are talking about Ayushman Bharat for free medical care and PM Awas Yojana to provide housing to people... Non-implementation of these two schemes will be the main reason for AAP's defeat in Delhi,"" Tiwari told HT on Wednesday, adding that party did not endorse the provocative statements of some of its MPs.

Over the last four years, the city has voted distinctly for distinct elections.

During the 2015 elections, the AAP bagged 54% of the vote share in the polls. But its vote share decreased in the next two elections held in the city -- the municipal elections in 2017 and the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. The AAP polled the highest share of votes in 2015; it stood second in the 2017 civic elections, with 26% of the votes, and finished third in five of the seven seats in the 2019 national elections, dropping to 18% of the votes and winning no seat.

On the contrary, both the BJP and the Congress improved in terms of vote share in this period. The BJP polled 56% votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, up from 36% in 2017 and 32% in 2015. In 2019, it had a lead in 65 of the 70 assembly constituencies. The Congress got just 10% of votes in 2015, 21% in 2017 and 23% in 2019.

Political observers believe that this election will significantly depend on whether voting patterns of the Lok Sabha election hold, or whether it reverts to the assembly pattern. A Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)-Lokniti poll conducted during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls showed that only about half of the people who voted for the BJP or the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls would have voted for the same party in case of a snap assembly election. The corresponding figure was 82% for the AAP.

The second variable is the impact of the campaign on the polls.

The AAP -- through government advertisements before the model code of conduct, public interaction programmes, townhall meetings by Kejriwal, hundreds of small corner meetings in Delhi neighbourhoods, dozens of rallies and roadshows, and a strong social media campaign -- has advertised its governance record.

In particular, it has focused on the improvement in government schools, public health systems, provision of electricity and water supply and subsidised rates, and free public transport for women. It has also promised to focus on pollution, provision of clean water and cleanliness in its next term if elected to power.

At the end of last year, the BJP had two key campaign planks. Through a parliamentary legislation, and then an announcement by PM Modi at a rally in Delhi, the party claimed credit for providing ownership documents to four million residents of unauthorised colonies in Delhi.

It also promised ""triple-engine governance"" under Modi, for the BJP would then hold the reins of power at the central, state and local level if elected to power.

But the party's campaign took a turn in the wake of protests against the CAA, particularly in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh area. Led by home minister Amit Shah, the party deployed its Cabinet ministers, MPs, former and current chief ministers, and the cadre of ideological affiliates of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to project the protests as ""anti-national"" in character and which suited Pakistan. It blamed the AAP and the Congress for backing these protests, spreading anarchy and violence, and causing inconvenience to the city's residents.

Commenting on the nature of the campaign, Shakti Sinha,a former bureaucrat who has served in the Delhi government and former director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, said: ""AAP's subsidy policy has huge long-term development costs in terms of forgone investment in infrastructure and sustainability, but has created a huge constituency of beneficiaries. Will the BJP be able to sell its message of nationalism and empowerment? It has stemmed the tide that was flowing against it but would it be enough to bring it to power?""

The third related strand was mobilisation of different segments. The AAP hopes to win the substantial support of the city's Muslim population -- which is influential in close to 10 seats. While the minorities had shifted in large numbers to the Congress in the Lok Sabha election, reports indicate they may consolidate behind AAP for they see it as the party best positioned to defeat the BJP. The AAP also hopes to win the support of the Hindu poor and the lower middle-class, primarily on the ground of having delivered tangible benefits to these segments through its welfare schemes. AAP has also sought to quell the impression, pushed by BJP, that it is against Hindu interests, with Kejriwal reciting the Hanuman Chalisa, going to the Hanuman temple on Friday, and candidates repeatedly emphasising their religious identity -- besides focusing on how the party has promised lessons in patriotism in school curricula and supporting moves such as the nullification of Article 370 that gave Jammu and Kashmir special status.

The BJP, for its part, is hoping to consolidate Hindus -- across different demographic segments, from Punjabis, Banias, Purvanchalis (migrants from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar), and Dalits. This is based on the premise that the largely Muslim-driven protests against CAA would antagonise the majority community.

It is here that the performance of the Congress will also play a role, for if it retains its base of Muslims and the poor, weaning them away from AAP, especially in constituencies where it has put up locally strong candidates, it may benefit the BJP.

""Ultimately, it may boil to how much vote the Congress attracts; the higher it is, the more AAP would suffer,"" Sinha said.

And the final strand is leadership. While AAP's mascot is Kejriwal, the BJP is primarily focusing on Modi as the face of the campaign. While the PM addressed only two rallies, it is his image that adorns the party's hoardings and advertisements. Just as in 2019, when the BJP asked who the opposition had to counter Modi, Kejriwal in 2020 is asking who the BJP has to counter him as the CM.

""Arvind Kejriwal is the pole along which these elections are being fought. The AAP is fighting on Kejriwal's charisma and his governance,"" said Neelanjan Sircar, who is affiliated with Ashoka University and the Centre for Policy Research. ""The BJP has ceded the governance narrative to the AAP, but is trying to paint Kejriwal as inimical to Hindu interests. And the Congress is a shadow of its former self.""

It remains to be seen if the BJP had polarised the electorate enough to pull off a win in Delhi, he added. ""Otherwise, it's advantage AAP.""",,,
125,,"Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column 'Roktok' in Sena mouthpiece Saamana, said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is only focused on creating a divide between Hindus and Muslims.

Raut said that while Modi is talking about winning a war with Pakistan in 8-10 days, Shah is looking at taking on the Muslims of the country.

The Sena leader also backed Delhi chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal in the upcoming polls as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader has carried out the work that people wanted. The Delhi election is scheduled for February 8.

In his column, Raut said the armed forces are suffering due to financial crisis and economic slowdown in the country.

""The soldiers of the border forces are not getting their allowance and the unemployed are not getting jobs in the country... If we leave aside Pakistan, the rupee has slid considerably. These are not good signs for the economy. The government should focus more on issues such as inflation, unemployment, and depreciating rupee-value. But the entire attention and force of the BJP?is on dividing the Hindus and Muslims of the country,"" Raut wrote. He added, ""Prime Minister Modi is giving speeches on war with Pakistan, while home minister Amit Shah is looking to fight the Muslims of the country.""

Last week, Modi at the NCC Cadet rally in Delhi had said, ""Pakistan has already lost three wars [with India]. Our armed forces will not take more than 8-10 days to make Pakistan bite the dust.""

""Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an expert in giving speeches. The PM makes speeches but things are not seen in action,"" the column read. The Sena leader added that the PM forgot the fact that soldiers at borders are not being provided with sufficient ration. ""During his NCC cadet speech, PM Modi gave an ultimatum to the Pakistan army. But his ideology in politics is not moving ahead of Pakistan. There are enemies at China border as well who are more dangerous than the Pakistan army. China has taken over Nepal and we are still stuck on Pakistan,"" he said.

Backing Kejriwal's AAP, Raut said that despite several attempts by the Centre, the Delhi CM has done good work. The Sena leader said that the level of campaigning for Delhi polls has slid like the value of the Indian rupee. ""The campaigning for Delhi has reached its peak, and BJP's 65 ministers and 200 MPs are talking about Pakistan and Muslims. Even then Arvind Kejriwal will win... An entire army of the BJP is campaigning; despite this, if BJP loses then it will be the loss of PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said Pakistan and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had felt pain when the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was withdrawn.

Mr. Adityanath said the Shaheen Bagh protest was a ""malicious attempt to disturb peace and normal life"" in the national capital.

Addressing a rally at Badarpur here, he said that in the Delhi election, on one side there was the leadership of Narendra Modi for development and nationalism, and on the other, there was the Congress and Mr. Kejriwal who ""support divisive forces"".

""The BJP is working with zero tolerance towards terrorism. But Kejriwal is busy sponsoring and offering biryani in Shaheen Bagh,"" he said.

The U.P. Chief Minister appealed to the people in Badarpur constituency to vote for the BJP, saying that the whole country and the world were watching them as to whom they support in the Delhi election.

Questioning the motive of the protesters at Shaheen Bagh, Mr. Adityanath alleged it was a ""pretext to oppose abrogation of Article 370, court's judgement on Ram temple and Triple Talaq ban.""

""The Shaheen Bagh protest is a pretext. They had to protest against the removal of Article 370 and construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. We can understand their problem. Their problem is ban on Triple Talaq.""

The protest at Shaheen Bagh in southeast Delhi, participated by large number of women, is going on since mid-December against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday asked the Election Commission to ban Mr. Adityanath from campaigning in the national capital over his alleged provocative speeches and also sought his arrest.

Mr. Adiyanath also slamemd the Kejriwal government for ""obstructing"" various government schemes in Delhi.

He said the BJP will implement these schemes including Kisan Samman Nidhi and Ayushman Bharat health scheme after forming the government in Delhi.

Asserting that he ensured peaceful Kanwar Yatras in Delhi, Mr. Adityanath said he has warned that those trying to ""attack"" these religious processions will have to face police bullets.

""I gave directions to make proper arrangements to welcome Lord shiva's devotees. People said riots will take place, but I said if anyone attacks Kanwar Yatras, then police bullets, and not merely words, will put sense into them.""

Mr. Ravi's comment on anti-CAA agitators is not an isolated case. Over the last month, the protesters have seen a barrage of similar responses by the BJP leaders in Karnataka.

In early January, BJP MLA Somashekar Reddy had said at a pro-CAA rally that those opposing the law should think of the ""consequences"" if the majority community hits the streets against them. A case has been booked against him in Ballari in this connection.

More recently, Chief Minister's political adviser MP Renukacharya, also at a pro-CAA rally, said that Muslims were collecting weapons in mosques instead of praying, kicking off a row. He refused to apologise for his comments and said that he would not extend any special packages to the community. Revenue Minister R. Ashok too had argued that ""anyone indulging in anti-national activities"" should be shot dead.

Opposition leaders in Karnataka who have spoken in support of anti-CAA protesters have also been on the receiving end. Health Minister B. Sriramulu recently chastised former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy for his ""fondness for Pakistan"" and said that he should settle in the neighbouring country. Mr. Kumaraswamy has been trolled extensively for his criticism of police action against anti-CAA demonstrators in Mangaluru, which left two people dead.

""Yesterday (Thursday) when Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke in the Lok Sabha on the CAA and NPR, he said the opposition parties are lying. It is the Prime Minister who spoke lies,"" he told presspersons.

In 2003, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister and Advani was the Home Minister, the Citizenship Act was amended and based on it rules were framed for NPR.

It was implemented only in 2010 for various reasons. It is not that the Congress or the UPA government introduced it and are objecting to it now.

Further, there is no relationship between the NPR and implementation of welfare schemes for the citizens.

The NPR rules were framed based on CAA. But, the Prime Minister tried to create an impression that implementation of the schemes will be affected if the NPR is not updated. The CPI (M) and the opposition parties are urging the citizens not to answer the questions when NPR is updated as if they do not give clear answers even for a few questions, they may be put in detention camps, he said.

Chandrasekhar Rao is a BJP ally and his government is ready to implement CAA, NRC and NPR in Telangana. He observed that the TRS opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament was only an attempt to mislead people, especially Muslims.

Similarly, the proposed resolution likely to be adopted in Assembly opposing the CAA would be another move to cheat people. ""What is preventing Mr. Rao from making an open statement that the State government would not implement CAA, NRC and NPR,"" he sought to know.

The Congress leader condemned Home Minister Mahmood Ali for his statement that NPR would be implemented in Telangana with six additional questions that require people to report the date and place of birth of their parents. He reminded that it was the Congress-led UPA government that had launched the population register in 2010 with 21 simple parameters and no community or individual had any objection to it.

133,,"In August 2017, I travelled to Kerala to shoot a special feature for Times Now on the series of political killings of RSS and Left workers, a bloody ongoing rivalry that dates back to the 1960s. The epicenter of this blood-feud is the district of Kannur, and a visit to the Communist Pary of India (Marxist) headquarters there provided a telling indication of the crisis of credibility that afflicts one of the self-proclaimed representatives of political liberalism in India. The four walls of the building's central hall are adorned with photographs of the party's 'martyrs' through the years, who've fallen at the hands of ideological and political rivals in a state where party or organizational affiliation worn as a badge of honour could also earn a place on an opponent's hit-list. But right above these photographs hung massive portraits of Communism's biggest icons, also some of the world's most ruthless tyrants. If Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong who murdered millions, eliminated rivals, and crushed dissent continue to inspire its cadres today, surely the moral high ground the Left likes to claim over a 'fascist-inspired Hindutva' propagated by the RSS and the BJP falls flat?

The ideological turf wars that the Left has waged against its opponents in Kerala and West Bengal, and the consequent retaliation, have claimed hundreds of lives through the decades. And yet, India's over-ground Communist parties are bracketed with the thoughts and ideas that social liberalism is meant to stand for: defending the right to free speech and expression, respect for religious and intellectual diversity, promoting inclusivity and accommodation, upholding one's fundamental rights and holding institutions accountable. But it's not just the Left that is undeserving of this association with liberalism. If the BJP, in the Opposition's eyes, is the anti-thesis of liberalism, the reality of India is that there's no other party worth its weight that can claim to truly represent itself as a liberal alternative.

One need not even go as far back as the Emergency or the anti-Sikh massacre to expose the Congress party's double-speak on liberalism. Several of the so-called 'urban naxals', such as Vernon Gonsalves and Sudhir Dhawale, whose arrests it now condemns as an act of muzzling dissent had brushes with the law and were jailed during the UPA tenure. The party's religious appeasement involved calls to fast-track terror cases where 'innocent' Muslims had been arrested, but it was the Maharashtra ATS reporting to a Congress-NCP government that jailed 10 Muslims for the 2006 Malegaon blasts. A decade later, they were acquitted with a large chunk of their life taken away from them, after the NIA under the UPA pursued a 'saffron-terror' angle, which too would wreck the lives of many Hindu under-trials before their cases fell flat.

Curbs on artistic creativity, bans on books, and imprisonment of cartoonists - remember Aseem Trivedi - are not a distant memory under the UPA rule. In fact, the UPA also stands guilty of not aggressively pushing for securing the rights of LGBTQIs as its reaction in 2009 when the Delhi High Court decriminalized homosexuality was guarded. It was only in 2013 when the Supreme Court overturned the 2009 verdict that the Congress' top brass including Rahul Gandhi spoke openly in favour of equal rights. And if that isn't enough, its opportunistic alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra represents anything but a commitment to the 'secular and liberal' values it claims to champion. It has clearly forgotten the 1992-93 Mumbai riots and the allegations it had leveled against the Shiv Sena over its participation, it has forgotten its own condemnations of the Sena's acts of vandalism, and its own accusations of its now-ally's 'fascist' leanings.

If that leaves Mamata Banerjee as a liberal alternative, one has to worry about the fate of liberalism in India. Her stature as a popular bulwark against the BJP in West Bengal has, among the BJP's critics, overshadowed the discourse around her own illiberal instincts, including jailing those who've caricatured her, and the violence of her party workers to preserve the hegemony the TMC currently enjoys in West Bengal. If the BJP's Hindutva assertion is a cause for alarm, Mamata Banerjee's desperation in ensuring the Muslim vote bank in West Bengal remains hers has been a recipe for polarization. And if one looks upon Mamata as a feminist for having fielded more women as candidates than her rivals, her party's confused response to triple talaaq, her silence on Sabarimala, or her callous reaction in 2012 to the Park Street rape are hardly assuring.

As for the AAP, many experts have speculated about their national viability after their triumph in Delhi. But Arvind Kejriwal's strategy of steering clear from commenting on 'national' issues, and preferring safety in silence than taking a position and drawing controversy clearly meant that he was shying away from an ideological fight.

But liberalism is alive, among the people and among certain institutions. The protests around the country against the CAA and the NRC cannot be simply dismissed as an overall expression of assertion by the Islamic fringe. Though it is undeniable that several radical Muslims have become involved, people from across faiths and across cities have participated in a movement that they believe is a necessary fight to protect the Indian Constitution. One can argue whether these fears are misplaced, but the BJP's climbdown on the NRC followed its own extremely bellicose campaign linking it with the CAA that only created uncertainty.

The prolonged lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir and the 'preventive' arrests of erstwhile allies of the ruling party have evoked considerable criticism, whatever one's views on Article 370. Civil society was very active in the legal campaign waged against Section 377, and the outrage against regressive practices such as triple talaaq was not confined to Muslim women. The apex court, by and large, has been receptive to this liberal impulse, be it in its decision to introspect on its own judgement on homosexuality and deliver a progressive verdict in 2018, decry the sexism and misogyny inherent in the erstwhile adultery law, and upholding India's identity as a secular state in its unanimous judgement in favour of Hindus in the Ayodhya case. While the Supreme Court's decision to re-examine its Sabarimala judgement allowing women between the ages of 10 to 50 entry into the temple has upset some liberals, its decision to deliberate on the matter under the larger rubric of women's rights together with discriminatory traditions in other religions may address the accusation of selectivity that both the court, and liberals, often invite.

But courts, fallible as they are, are an instrument of last resort, when faith in elected representatives has eroded. Unfortunately, that is the case in India. If India's liberals cringe about the BJP's free run to its communal rabble-rousers during election campaigns, or the branding of its critics as anti-nationals or part of a discredited 'Lutyens or Khan Market' cabal, there's virtually nothing they can celebrate about the Opposition. India's liberals know what they're opposing, and are making their voices heard, but there's no party they can really support.",,,
134,,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Thursday said the Nehru-Liaquat agreement of 1950 explicitly mentioned that citizenship would be religion-neutral as it accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of misleading the house to justify the controversial CAA.

Congress slammed Modi's speech in Lok Sabha as ""oscillating between stand-up comedy, half-truths and rank communalism"". AICC leader Rahul Gandhi accused the PM of distracting the country by talking about everything except youth unemployment.

After Modi quoted first premier Jawaharlal Nehru's pact with Pakistan and his communications with Assam's first chief minister to say that Nehru too wanted citizenship for minorities, AICC spokesman Manish Tewari slammed him for selectively quoting ""his illustrious predecessor"" and demanded that he apologise to the country. Congress said Modi had compromised national pride by mentioning Pakistan seven times in his speech and undoing the success of UPA regime in de-hyphenating India and Pakistan.",,,
135,,"All the regional parties have surrendered to the saffron party'

The Congress is the only party that can fight against the ruling BJP at the Centre, and to which all the regional parties, including the YSRCP, the TDP and the JSP, have surrendered, according to newly appointed APCC president S. Sailajanath.

Speaking at his swearing-in here on Wednesday, Mr. Sailajanath said all the regional parties were bowing before the Centre that was taking ""anti-people decisions.""

In such a scenario, it was only the Congress that could stand by the people and fight for them, he said.

Mr. Sailajanath dared Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to pass a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR) in the Assembly.

He asked the Congress activists and leaders to come out of their comfort zones and reach out to the masses.

Oommen Chandy, Congress party in-charge of Andhra Pradesh, said, ""The party's position in the State is not good, but we have good space here. Special Category Status (SCS) was assured by the UPA, but the BJP failed to accord it because it is against the State. The regional parties are weakened. The YSRCP government in the State has also become unpopular in a short time.""

""I request all the leaders who left the party in A.P. to return. We welcome them,"" he said, and asked the party rank and file to garner the support of people by taking to the streets and strengthen the party.

N. Tulasi Reddy and Sk. Mastan Vali were sworn-in as working president of the party in the State.

Senior leader and Rajya Sabha member K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao, Nalgonda MP and Telangana PCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy, former Union Ministers K.H. Muniyappa, M.M. Pallam Raju, and J.D.

136,,"NEW DELHI: With the Budget session of Parliament due to begin later this week, Congress is readying a ""vigorous"" two-pronged attack on the Modi government over the controversial CAA-NRC-NPR as well as on the downward spiral of the economy.

Party sources said the session will see Congress corner the government over economic stress, increasing joblessness, plunging GDP and rising inflation on the one hand, while on the other, it will also continue its attack on the government over its ""communal and divisive"" agenda -- displayed though the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Congress will also hold a training session for its MPs, general secretaries and senior party functionaries on February 4, to explain to them the differences between the NPR proposed by BJP -- with the additional questions -- and the one that was mooted by the UPA government in its first term. Party sources said the leadership feels there is a need to have complete clarity among its members on what Congress is opposing in the new NPR and why it believes that the additional data is, in fact, being collected as a pre-cursor to NRC.

""After coming under attack over NRC, the government has now mooted NPR which is nothing but the first step to NRC. While the government is now trying to confuse people by claiming that the information sought under NPR is optional, we want to expose the government's real segregationist agenda behind the exercise,"" a Congress functionary said.

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram who was Union home minister when the idea of NPR was first mooted, will lead the training session to explain the differences between the old and new NPR to Congress functionaries. He will be aided in the exercise by his Rajya Sabha colleague Jairam Ramesh.",,,
137,,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday warned that street protests and arson against decisions of Parliament and state assemblies and people's refusal to accept laws will lead to anarchy, as he accused the Congress and other opposition parties of inciting protests against the CAA and the NPR.

Stoutly defending the Citizenship (Amendment) Act(CAA) and the updation of the National Population Register(NPR), Modi told Parliament there is an attempt to cover undemocratic activity under the garb of protests and that no one is going to get political benefit.

The prime minister accused the Opposition of using all its might to stoke ""imaginary"" fears about the CAA and the NPR which is worrisome and dangerous for the country.

""Don't try to mislead people"", Modi asserted, as he likened the Opposition's stand on the CAA to that of Pakistan, saying Islamabad spoke the same language for decades to mislead and incite Indian Muslims.

Modi tore into the Opposition in marathon combative speeches in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and said those rejected by people in elections are fuelling protests against the CAA and the NPR for their ""vote bank politics"". The fresh attack against the Opposition came two days ahead of the Assembly polls in Delhi which has witnessed protests in Shaheen Bagh, Jamia Millia and other areas.

Maintaining that the CAA does not affect any Indian citizen and poses no harm to minorities and that opposing NPR for political reasons will deprive the poor of benefits of welfare schemes, the prime minister said instead of scaring people right information needs to be provided and that there should be proper discussions. Questions asked in the NPR are purely governance related, he stressed.

The prime minister said Census and the NPR are ""usual administrative"" processes which have been carried out previously as well but have now suddenly become contentious.

Modi was replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address. The Motion was later adopted by the two Houses.

The prime minister delivered a stinging rebuttal to the Opposition over most issues its members raised to criticise his government and took on the charge that he pursued communal politics and wanted Hindu rashtra. He cited comments of Jawaharlal Nehru to back the law and said the Congress stalwart wanted citizenship for minorities from Pakistan.

Modi said Nehru had wanted to defend minorities in then West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

""Was he communal, did he want to create a Hindu Rashtra...I want to ask the Congress,"" the prime minister said.

Modi also touched on the issues of Kashmir, economy, unemployment and farmers distress while taking frequent digs at rivals, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi whom he dubbed a ""tubelight"". Describing Jammu and Kashmir as the ""crown jewel of India"", he said the identity of Kashmir was buried when the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits began in 1990.

Amid thumping of benches by ruling BJP members and their allies, the prime minister invoked the Constitution to warn against street protests to oppose decisions taken by Parliament and state assemblies.

The Congress was expected to be a responsible Opposition, but it had taken a wrong turn, he said.

Noting that the CAA was passed by Parliament and duly notified, he told opposition parties that the road taken by them raises worries, a reference to anti-CAA protests and support to them by many anti-BJP parties.

""What will happen if people refuse to accept a decision taken by the Rajasthan assembly, stage dharnas and resort to arson?' Modi asked and gave a similar example of Madhya Pradesh. The Congress is in power in the two states.

""What will then happen? Can the country run this way? This is road to anarchy... Such a way can put you (Opposition) in trouble as well. I am giving this warning as we all should be concerned about the country.""

""It is due to your work that people have sent you there,"" he said, referring to the opposition benches. ""Everybody has a right to put across their point of views but no good will come out of spreading lies and rumours. Respect the Constitution,"" he added.

People associated with the Congress and the Left have been inciting people, he said.

Dwelling at length on the NPR in the Rajya Sabha, Modi said it was being updated to allow the rightful beneficiaries get the benefit of government welfare schemes. The NPR was first done in 2010 and later updated in 2015, he added.

He said census and the NPR are ""usual administrative"" processes which have been carried out previously as well but have now suddenly become contentious.

Questions asked in the NPR are purely governance related, he said, citing the example of asking citizens of the language spoken by them and their parents are deeply linked to the schools that need to be set up in that particular area.

""They are opposing (NPR) for narrow and frivolous political narrative. This is anti-poor,"" he said, adding his government had made productive use of the data collected by previous NPR to give benefits of the schemes to the poor. He asked opposition parties to not politicise the issue for narrow political gains.

""We have record of your NPR, no citizen was persecuted based on that record of NPR,"" he said, citing the statement of the home minister of the Congress-led UPA government appealing to citizens to enrol in the exercise.

Hitting back at the Congress over its charge that his government violated the Constitution, Modi said it should be the party's mantra to speak 100 times a day about ""saving Constitution"" so that it remembers its sanctity.

Modi said India can no longer wait for problems to remain unsolved, and, rightfully so. ""That is why, our aim is speed and scale, determination and decisiveness, sensitivity and solutions"".

""The people of India have not only changed the Sarkar (government). They want the 'Sarokar' (conduct) to be changed as well. If we had worked according to the old ways and thought processes: Article 370 would never have been history. Muslim women would have kept suffering due to triple talaq,"" he said.

The prime minister said if his government worked as per the old ways, the Ram Janmabhoomi issue would have remained unsolved, Kartarpur Sahib corridor would not be a reality and there would be no India-Bangladesh land agreement.",,,
138,,"New Delhi: Referring to the anti-CAA protests in the city, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Monday said that people were still ""confused"" about the amendment made to the law and were creating an ""atmosphere of unrest"".

While urging protesters to practice restraint and maintain peace, Tiwari, who is a Member of Parliament from North East Delhi where violent clashes erupted on Sunday between those favouring and opposing CAA, said lakhs of people were being ""harassed"" due to the agitations.

""Under the guise of peaceful demonstration, miscreants are harassing millions of Delhiites by protesting on roads and committing violent activities. It is now important that they be controlled as soon as possible,"" Tiwari said.

Former Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken, however, urged chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to not appear ""helpless"" and take the ""lead"" in bringing the situation firmly in control.

In a series of tweets, Maken suggested setting up of a helpline to take complaints of violence or police inaction, calling an all-party meet to take suggestions from functionaries across party lines and formation of peace committees in troubled areas.

Maken, who was junior home minister in the UPA-II government between 2009-11, said he was making the suggestions to deal with Delhi riots on the basis of his experience in dealing with numerous administrative responsibilities.

In his tweets, Maken suggested: ""Establish a helpline directly under your office to receive complaints of violence or police inaction. This should be monitored and further passed on to police and the local SDM. Immediately call an all-party meeting, take suggestions and work across political parties to restore normalcy in troubled areas. Form peace committees with social influencers, including MLAs, councillors, district magistrate, local SHO and SDM. Make each minister of your cabinet in chargeof such committees and ask them to hit the ground.""

The senior Congress functionary also asked the chief minister to establish a hotline with the lieutenant governor and talk to him every hour to take stock of the situation. ""Take a lead and don't sit back blaming others. As a CM, please do not appear to be helpless. This would badly erode a much-needed credibility of our democratic institutions to protect atrocity/violence against innocent citizens,"" he added.

Senior BJP functionary and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel said he will start a campaign against Shaheen Bagh protests on March 1 from Delhi University's Bonta Park. He added he will visit parks across the city every morning to talk about Shaheen Bagh.

""Women at Shaheen Bagh are being exploited as shields by Opposition parties. This is a very well-thought conspiracy to instigate riots,"" the MP claimed.",,,
139,,"JAIPUR: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused PM Modi of destroying India's image and scaring away investors, and urged the youth to not let their voice be suppressed.

Addressing the 'Yuva Aakrosh' rally in Jaipur, Rahul, however, refrained from speaking directly against CAA, but lashed out at the Modi government for failing to generate jobs for the youth. Coming down heavily on the Modi government's promise of creating 2 crore jobs every year, he claimed that 1-crore people had lost their jobs the past year alone. ""Where are the 12 crore jobs of six years,"" he asked.

""Modi gives long speeches on CAA, NRC and NPR but prefers to remain silent on unemployment,"" he said. ""The growth rate during UPA's tenure stood at 9%, which has now fallen to below 5%, according to the new parameters for calculating GDP (gross domestic product). If we calculate it as per the earlier parameters, it will be around 2.5%,"" he added.

Urging the youth not to let their voices be suppressed, the former Congress chief encouraged them to ask questions on employment and the country's future. Rahul said India was known as a country of peace and harmony, often cited as a contrast to Pakistan. But the image is now tarnished and businessmen are wary of investing, he claimed.

""PM Modi has destroyed India's reputation in the world. Today, India is known as the rape capital, but Modi does not talk about this,"" he said.. When the youth raise questions over unemployment and ask Modi why he ""destroyed"" India's image, they ""are answered with bullets and are suppressed"", Rahul remarked.

Accusing the Opposition of inciting protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday warned that street agitations against decisions of Parliament and State Assemblies may lead to ""anarchy"" and that everyone should be worried over it.

Strongly defending the CAA that has triggered protests, PM Modi reiterated in Lok Sabha that it does not affect any Indian citizen and poses no harm to minorities, and said those rejected by people in elections are fuelling protests against it for their ""vote bank politics"".

He accused the Opposition of using all its might to stoke ""imaginary"" fears about the law, which grants citizenship to minorities from three Muslim countries in the neighbourhood, and likened its stand to that of Pakistan, saying Islamabad spoke the same language for decades to mislead and incite Indian Muslims.

Pakistan could not succeed, and what has surprised him that those thrown out of power by voters have resorted to doing such things, Mr. Modi said in his over 100-minute-long reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address, which was later passed by Lok Sabha.

So much criticism of the CAA has been made ironically by those who love getting photographed with the group of people who want ""tukde tukde"" of India, he said, adding that even courts have asserted that protests should not inconvenience people and be not marked by violence.

""We have seen the kind of speeches and remarks were made recently (in these protests). Big leaders of Opposition go there. I regret it,"" he said.

BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, have often hit out at these protests, including the one in Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, saying anti-India and radical speeches have been made.

He hit back at the Congress over its charge that his government violated the Constitution. PM Modi said it should be the Party's mantra to speak frequently about ""saving Constitution"" so that it remembers its sanctity.

The Congress government imposed the Emergency, curbed judiciary's powers, spoke against people's right to life and dismissed Opposition-run State governments frequently, he said. ""We believe in the Constitution,"" he added.

He also dubbed the National Advisory Council, a body set up during the UPA era to advise the Manmohan Singh government and headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, as a ""remote control"" that enjoyed a ""bigger role"" than the Prime Minister.

Questioning if such a body was constitutional, Mr. Modi also recalled as to how Rahul Gandhi had torn a bill passed by the UPA government to attack the Congress.

Mr. Modi recited a verse to take a swipe at Opposition parties for their backing to anti-CAA protests and referred to their leaders making speeches there.

People associated with the Congress and the Left have been inciting people, he said.

Quoting Nehru, Mr. Modi said India's first Prime Minister in a letter to the then Assam Chief Minister in 1950 had asked him to distinguish between Hindu refugees and Muslim migrants from Pakistan and said the law should be amended to grant citizenship to the refugees if required.

""This was not only Mahatma Gandhi's but also Nehru's sentiments. Was Pandit Nehru communal? Did he discriminate between Hindus and Muslims? Did he want Hindu rashtra?"" Mr. Modi asked, asserting that several reports, including those of Parliamentary panels, had recommended a law such as the CAA.

He said the Congress is having problems when his government is taking decisions to fulfil wishes of the country's ""founding fathers"".

The Opposition has frequently accused the Modi government of pursuing communal politics, discriminating against Muslims and seeking to make India a Hindu rashtra.

The country would not have seen the real face of the Opposition if it had not made so much of noise against the law, he said.

Taking a swipe at Opposition members for invoking contributions of Muslims to India's freedom struggle, he said they look at them as Muslims but they are Indians to his party.

The Prime Minister said that he in his youth had touched the feet of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and named other greats such as Ashfaqullah Khan, Begum Hazrat Mahal and A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to assert that they were all Indians.

Describing Kashmir as ""crown jewel"" of India, he said his government has pushed development measures in Jammu and Kashmir and asserted that it had faith in the people of Valley.

Mr. Modi cited comments of Kashmir leaders Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, who had warned that any decision to nullify Article 370 may sever the Valley's link with India, to ask if those who believe in India's Constitution can tolerate these remarks.

Mr. Modi said Kashmir's identity was buried on January 19, 1990, when Kashmiri Pandits started leaving the Valley due to militancy.

Elaborating on his government's achievements, the Prime Minister said the people of the country have seen his government's work between 2014 and 2019 and gave a bigger mandate in 2019.

PM Modi said India can no longer wait for problems to remain unsolved, and, rightfully so. ""That is why, our aim is speed and scale, determination and decisiveness, sensitivity and solutions"".

Without naming Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Modi said, ""I heard an Opposition MP saying 'we will beat Modi with sticks in 6 months' I have also decided I will do more 'Surya Namaskar'.

This will make my back even stronger to face abuses. In any case, I have been abused so much for the last two decades that their negativity hardly matters.""

Referring to the Northeast, PM Modi said, ""The Bodo Accord signed now is special because it has brought all stakeholders together and we are moving towards a more peaceful era. It has ushered in a new dawn.""",,,
141,,"The government has stated in Parliament that it hasn't taken any decision yet on preparing a National Register of Indian Citizens, but this may not be enough to bridge the political trust deficit. A shelving of the nationwide NRC project, or at least declaring a five-year moratorium pending the generation of greater consensus around it, would have worked better. Given the radical nature of the exercise - in effect, requiring all Indian citizens to prove their citizenship all over again, to the satisfaction of petty bureaucracy - the extent of mistrust it has generated was to be expected. That mistrust is only reinforced by the Assam chapter of NRC being acknowledged to be a failure by all sides including BJP.

Some states where opposition parties are in office are now unwilling to proceed with the National Population Register updation, and many others betray uneasiness over the exercise. This is a pity as NPR, which could have been used to strengthen welfare measures, is now falling victim to the CAA-NRC controversy. Unlike UPA which did not pursue NRC after the first NPR exercise in 2010, the NDA government has become a victim of BJP's powerful hyper-nationalist messaging that jumped the gun by promising a nationwide NRC to follow the controversial CAA it legislated. The Citizenship Rules, 2003, envisage NPR as the staging point for a local and national register of citizens. So it was but natural for critics to link NPR, for which funds were sanctioned in December 2019, to the nationwide NRC that top BJP leaders were promising for several months.

It would be useful here to fall back on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's original call for 'minimum government, maximum governance', and refocus on the economy that is in dire need of attention. With NRC out of the way, the government will be in a position to recreate optimism around India's economic prospects.",,,
142,,"NEW DELHI: From sprucing up the sprawling ground to extensive traffic and security arrangements, workers and authorities were busy making final preparations at the historic Ramlila Maidan here for the swearing-in ceremony of Arvind Kejriwal as chief minister of Delhi for the third successive time on Sunday.

Preparations underway at Ramlila Maidan.

Big banners bearing messages like 'Dhanyawad Dilli' along with the image of the AAP supremo were put up on Saturday in and around the venue ahead of the mega function which is ""open to public"".

With AAP scripting its third consecutive win in the Delhi assembly elections, excitement is palpable among party workers and senior leaders alike, all of whom are expecting a huge crowd at the event.

Around 50 people from different walks of life who are responsible for 'Delhi nirman' will share stage with Kejriwal during his swearing-in ceremony, AAP leader Manish Sisodia said.

He said these people would include teachers, bus marshalls, architects of the Signature Bridge and families of fire fighters who lost their lives.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the ceremony, besides BJP MPs and MLAs from Delhi. The AAP had said no chief minister or political leader from other states will be part of the event as it will be a ""Delhi-specific"" ceremony.

On the eve of swearing-in ceremony, Kejriwal called a dinner meeting of his ministers-designate to discuss the roadmap for Delhi's development, especially the initiatives that need to be prioritised in the coming three months, according to party functionaries.

All the six ministers in the previous government -- Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gehlot, Imran Hussain and Rajendra Gautam -- have been retained.

Workers were on Saturday giving a fresh paint job to the white ceremonial platform at the Ramlila Maidan, and the area around it was being decked up with potted plants and flowers.

A large contingent of security personnel was given briefing by Delhi Police authorities at the Maidan.

Officials said 2,000 to 3,000 security personnel from the Delhi Police and paramilitary forces, including the CRPF, were being deployed for the ceremony which is scheduled to begin at 10 am. Drones were likely to be used for aerial surveillance.

Traffic regulations will be in place in the area from 8 am to 2 pm, they said.

Senior AAP leader Gopal Rai said as this is an event open for public.

""We are expecting a good number of people to turn up tomorrow,"" he said.

""Baby Mufflerman'' Aavyan Tomar, who stole the hearts when he dressed up as the AAP convenor on counting day, is a 'special invitee' at the ceremony.

The AAP supremo had on Thursday extended invitation to Delhiites to attend his oath-taking ceremony to ""bless their son"". Advertisements were also issued in leading dailies.

""Delhiites, your son is going to take oath of Delhi chief minister for the third time. You must come to bless your son. Sunday, February 16, 10 am, Ramlila Maidan,"" Kejriwal had tweeted in Hindi.

Rai had earlier said that all seven Delhi MPs and the eight newly-elected BJP MLAs have been invited for the oath-taking ceremony.

In a near-repeat performance of 2015, the Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party, which was floated in November 2012, retained power with a scintillating win in the just-concluded Delhi assembly polls, trouncing its main rival BJP and completely decimating the Congress in a keenly-watched battle that took place in the midst of anti-CAA protests.

As the AAP bagged 62 out of the 70 seats, leaders cutting across party lines, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi (Congress), Sharad Pawar (NCP), Mamata Banerjee (TMC), Naveen Patnaik (BJD) and MK Stalin (DMK) had congratulated Kejriwal for the victory.

For the 51-year-old bureaucrat-turned-politician who will assume the post of Delhi chief minister for the third time, the Ramlila Maidan holds special significance as it had served as his battleground during the Anna Hazare-led India Against Corruption movement.

The Delhi government, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which owns the Maidan, and public works department are working in tandem to make the venue ready for the occasion.

""We had levelled the ground during the PM's event that took place recently. So, other ground work is being done. The PWD is making necessary arrangements too,"" a senior NDMC official said.

Toilet blocks are in place in and around the Maidan. Arrangements for other sanitation facilities like mobile toilets, are being done, he said.

The ground, where socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan had addressed a massive gathering during the 'Total Revolution' movement in 1970s, has a capacity of about 1.25 lakh people.

Sources said that besides seating arrangements, there will be space for people to stand.

In 2015 too, Kejriwal's oath-taking ceremony had taken place at Ramlila Maidan. It was held on February 14, coinciding with the Valentine's Day.

In 2013 after his party's first poll victory, the swearing-in ceremony was held at the same venue. Over a lakh people had attended the event on December 29 that year.

The AAP had in 2015 stunned its opponents with a massive win in the assembly polls, clinching 67 seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly.

Kejriwal repeated his triumph in the high-profile New Delhi constituency, defeating Bharatiya Janata Party's Sunil Kumar Yadav by a margin of 21,697 votes.",,,

With opposition members carrying placards and raising slogans against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Speaker adjourned the House after a little over 10 minutes following the Question Hour. He emphasised that it was for lunch.

People are protesting to protect the Constitution and are carrying national flags, Chowdhury said, alleging that some protesters were killed ""mercilessly"".

""You are fake Hindus,"" he said, attacking the BJP, and added that if its members were ""asli (genuine) Hindus"", then they would have behaved differently.

Thakur, who is the minister of state for finance and corporate affairs, had made some controversial remarks during a recent poll rally in the national capital.

He was banned from campaigning by the Election Commission for three days for egging on people to raise the slogan ""shoot the traitors"", after he lashed out at anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protesters.

Belligerent Congress members, who were in the Well, shouted slogans against the minister and asked ""Aapka goli kaha hai? (where is your bullet?)"".

Some members also shouted ""Goli maarna band karo (Stop shooting)"".

Whenever Thakur was responding to supplementaries during the Question Hour, the members began sloganeering against him.

Opposition members, including those from the Congress and the DMK, also walked out of Lok Sabha to protest the controversial remarks by BJP member Parvesh Verma during a poll rally, when he rose to initiate a debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address .

As soon as Verma rose to initiate the debate, opposition members raised slogans against him like ""sharm karo (have shame)"".

Speaker Om Birla said what a member says outside cannot be raised inside the House and that members should not set a ""wrong precedent"".

Verma was barred by the Election Commission last week for four days for his controversial remarks made during an interview and at an election meeting.

Verma took on the Congress for its opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act, saying, ""They should know that it is not Rajiv Feroze Khan government, it is Narendra Modi's government.

""We will not take back CAA. It is a question of the country's integrity.""

He referred to the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, saying it is not a protest against Citizenship Amendment Act, rather people there are saying ""Pakistan zindabad, and Assam and Kashmir should be separated from India.""

Verma said India is proud to have such a President who has rejected the mercy plea of Nirbhaya convicts.

Congress' Gaurav Gogoi demanded that Thakur be booked under relevant laws.

He alleged that political masters at the top are giving directions to ministers to make inflammatory speeches.

""Book the minister"" under relevant laws, he said without taking any name.

""In front of Delhi police, a boy fired on the people,"" the Congress leader said adding ""he must have been motivated by someone"".

""I want to know who is pulling the trigger. It's not the minister or that boy,"" he added.

PK Kunhalikuty (IUML) said that in the Delhi election rallies while the AAP and the Congress are talking about development, the BJP is trying to make it as ""communal as possible"".

""They are even giving a call to shoot people. People sitting in high offices are making these calls,"" he alleged, adding they are targeting a minority community in the country.

He said that no senior BJP leader is condemning such remarks.

""The Prime Minister talks about new India but it is full of hatred, anarchy and joblessness,"" he alleged.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to reply to the debate on Wednesday.",,,
144,,"NEW DELHI: No one in the BJP is worthy of becoming chief minister of Delhi, AAP supremo and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday, the last day of campaigning before the February 8 assembly elections.

People want to know who will be the Bharatiya Janata Party's chief ministerial candidate, Kejriwal told PTI in an interview, and asked what if the party chooses Sambit Patra or Anurag Thakur for the post.

He said the Bharatiya Janata Party had tried to polarise the assembly polls, and asserted that results will show if it succeeded or not.

""AAP voters are those who want good education, medical treatment, modern roads, 24-hour electricity,"" Kejriwal said.

Discussing the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh, the AAP national convener alleged that the BJP has not cleared the Shaheen Bagh road because of the assembly elections.

""What stopped Union home minister Amit Shah from clearing the stretch. What is Amit Shah's interest in keeping the road blocked? Why do they want to trouble the people of Delhi and do dirty politics over the protests?"" Kejriwal asked.

Continuing his attack on the BJP, he added that the saffron party's leaders have ""completely forgotten"" the city's unauthorised colonies and are misleading the people.

""Delhi government's 'free schemes' will continue if AAP voted back to power, we will introduce more schemes if needed,"" said Kejriwal.",,,
145,,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra claimed on Wednesday that the juvenile who shot at and injured a student at an anti-CAA protest gathering near the Jamia Millia Islamia University last week was a voter of the Jewar assembly constituency in Uttar Pradesh.

At a press conference, Chopra also cited the voter identity card number of the accused and sought a probe into the matter by a government agency.

The accused fired at a group of anti-CAA protesters near Jamia Millia, injuring a student, on January 31. Police caught him and sent him to protective custody.

""This person voted in the last Lok Sabha election. His name is registered as a voter in the electoral roll of Jewar assembly constituency,"" Chopra said, citing the accused's voter photo identity card number.

""If it is true, which forces are trying to protect him? Terming him a juvenile, he is being let off. This should be probed by a government agency,"" he said.

The Congress leader also slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), accusing them of trying to ""polarise"" the February 8 Delhi assembly polls.

""They are bent on spoiling the peace before the polls,"" he alleged.

Chopra also demanded a probe into the firing near the Shaheen Bagh protest site by Kapil Baisala on February 1, who the police claimed was associated with the AAP.

He appealed to people to maintain peace and said if anything happened to the women protesters at Shaheen Bagh, no one would forgive the BJP and the AAP.

Chopra also demanded Union home minister Amit Shah's resignation and ""sacking"" of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the shooting incidents near anti-CAA protest sites in the national capital.",,,
146,,"NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 61.46 per cent voter turnout on Saturday, down from 67.47 per cent in 2015 assembly election, with exit polls predicting an easy win for AAP, which sought to retain power on development plank, against the BJP that ran an aggressive campaign centred around the issues of anti-CAA protests and nationalism.

The polling went off peacefully, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh told reporters.

Over 60,000 security personnel, including Quick Response Teams, had been deployed for the election while police and paramilitary forces conducted flag marches in sensitive areas.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

The voting percentage was 57.04 till 6 pm deadline, and rose to 61.46 per cent as those in queues at polling stations were allowed to vote, poll officials said, adding it may increase further.

The officials said Mustafabad (66.29 per cent), Matia Mahal (65.62 per cent) and Seelampur (64.92 per cent) -- all three with large Muslim population -- recorded the highest voting percentage till 5 pm.

Long queues were seen outside polling stations in areas like Jaffrabad, Jamia Nagar, Turkman Gate and Shaheen Bagh which have been witnessing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

In the 11 districts in the national capital, northeast recorded 65.24 per cent turn out, northwest (62.23 per cent), south (59.65 per cent), central (58.57 per cent), southwest 61.57 (per cent), east (61.29 per cent), west (61.79 per cent), north (57.19 per cent), New Delhi (56.10 per cent), Shahadra (62.96 per cent) and southeast (54.89 per cent).

On a sit-in for over a month against the Citizenship Amendment Act, women protesters at Shaheen Bagh in south-east Delhi voted in batches ""so that the agitation remains unaffected"".

Mehzabeen Qureshi, who returned to the protest site after voting, said, ""I stayed at home to let other women in the house go out and vote. Now I have joined them here at Shaheen Bagh after voting. I voted today to secure democracy"".

Polling started at a sluggish pace and the voting percentage was low till noon. However, it picked up pace as the day grew warmer.

A senior Delhi poll official said the lower turnout compared to 67.47 per cent in the 2015 Assembly polls could be attributed to the polling day falling on a weekend as a section of people may have gone out of the city. The voting percentage was 60.6 in 2019 Lok Sabha election.

A poll officer died apparently due to a heart condition at a polling booth at Babarpur, just before the voting began, Singh said.

Congress' Chandni Chowk candidate Alka Lamba got into an altercation with an AAP worker outside a polling booth and tried to slap the man, but missed.

Lamba alleged that the man used ""very foul"" and objectional language against her.

Free electricity and water, development, jobs, national security and CAA were among the key issues on the minds of Delhiites in the polls where 672 candidates were in the fray in 70 Assembly seats.

Sonakshi Ranjan (22), a first-time voter, said she opted for development while casting her vote. S C Sharma (74), a voter in Kalkaji constituency, said he voted for development and national security.

Exit polls have predicted a clean sweep for the ruling Aam Aadmi Party while the BJP was a distant second.

Most exit polls also predicted that Congress is unlikely to open its account even this time in Delhi, which it ruled from 1998-2013.

After the polls ended, BJP President J P Nadda held a meeting with party's Delhi unit leaders and took stock of the situation. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari put up a brave face amid prediction of defeat for his party, claiming it will win 48 seats and form a government in the city.

AAP leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said his party is going to win with a big margin.

There were some complaints related to VVPAT slips. Congress' New Delhi candidate Romesh Sabharwal said VVAPT slips did not show his name and photo.

""I gave a written complaint to poll authorities after which the machine was replaced,"" Sabharwal said, adding that polling was halted for sometime.

Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh said that Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) failure was only one per cent this time.

""There was very little VVPAT failure this time. In the Lok Sabha election, the VVPAT failure was more than 12.5 per cent and this time it is less than 1 per cent,"" he said.

""Because of our enforcement and preventive action we took, the elections went off peacefully,"" Singh told reporters.

Police said over 200 calls related to election complaints were received at the Delhi Police's control room on the polling day.

First time voters and women turned out in large numbers. More than 60 centenarians voted in the assembly polls, Singh said.

President Ram Nath Kovind, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma and Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari also exercised their franchise. Union Ministers S Jaishankar and Hardeep Singh Puri were also among those who cast their votes.

Chief Minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal voted at Rajpur Transport Authority polling station in the Civil Lines area.

Kejriwal, who is contesting the polls from the New Delhi constituency, was accompanied by his wife Sunita and son Pulkit. Before leaving for voting, he sought his parents' blessings.

Former vice president Hamid Ansari and senior RSS functionary Ram Lal were among those who queued up outside the Nirman Bhavan polling station in the first hour of voting.

Minutes before polling began, Kejriwal tweeted, ""Please go to cast vote. A special appeal to all the women - as you shoulder the responsibility at home, likewise, the responsibility of the country and Delhi is on your shoulders.""

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who covered 60 assembly seats during his whirlwind campaign, appealed to voters to ""free"" the national capital from lies and vote-bank politics.

""By giving Delhi clean air, clean drinking water and every poor house, only the best capital of the world can make it a government with far-sighted thinking and strong intentions.

""I appeal to the people of Delhi to vote to free Delhi from lies and vote bank politics,"" Shah tweeted.

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's son Rehan and Kejriwal's son Pulkit were among first-time voters.

Asked if his father will be the CM again, Pulkit said whoever people choose will become the chief minister of Delhi.

Talking to reporters, Rehan said that public transport should be more affordable for students.

Taking a swipe at those protesting against CAA-NRC, senior RSS functionary Ram Lal said those shouting ""kagaz nahin dikhayenge"" would be defeated in the Delhi assembly election as he appealed to people to show documents while voting.

He asked voters to keep in mind who can make Delhi the best capital city in the world.

Hundreds of people, protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in many areas across the country, often raise the slogan of ""kagaz nahi dikhayenge"" (we will not show show documents).

""My message to the voters is 'aaj apna kagaz jaroor lekar jayen. Kagaz jaroor dikhayen' (Today, take your document along with you and show your document),"" Lal said.",,,
147,,"NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday questioned the timing and motive behind the recent revelation by Delhi Police in connection with the shooting incident at anti-CAA protest site in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh.

Responding to the Delhi Police's crime branch's revelations that Kapil Gujjar, the man who had opened fire in Shaheen Bagh on February 1, was an AAP member, the ruling party in Delhi blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for playing ""dirty politics"" in the run-up to the assembly polls in the national capital.

Addressing a press conference, AAP leader Sanjay Singh questioned how the probe details reached Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari even before they were released by the police.

""At whose behest the Delhi Police is making a statement? How did the investigation detail reach BJP leaders even before the news came out. Manoj Tiwari made a statement this morning that the accused is from the AAP. How did the Delhi BJP chief come to know about it in advance?"" asked AAP leader Sanjay Singh while reacting to Kapil Gujjar being called an AAP man by the cops.

""Amit Shah is the home minister of the country right now. And before the elections, many more photos and conspiracies will be found. There are just three to four days left for the elections. BJP will do as much dirty politics as they can. What does having a picture with someone means?"" Singh asked ANI.

""Conduct investigations in the crime and take action against the accused. Do not try to disillusion the people of Delhi. The matter is not related to a photo, but of a crime and we have been demanding strict action against the accused from day one,"" he added.

Terming the announcement made by Delhi Police a violation of the Model Code of Conduct, Singh said his party would lodge a complaint with the election commission.

""Investigation has not been completed, photos have not been investigated and a police officer is taking a party's name, at a time when the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is in place. Tomorrow, we will complain to Election Commission (EC) against Rajesh Deo,"" said Sanjay Singh.",,,
148,,"Flickr....flickr....flick. PM Modi has just called Rahul Gandhi a tubelight. Yes, before the 2019 general elections, Rahul could have been rightly accused of being a tubelight. Even though he shed the pappu tag with victories in MP, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh, the flick after flickr....flickr didn't arrive.

PM Modi was there for the taking in 2019, but Rahul completely lost the plot with Rafale and whatnot. He took defeat heavily, going into hibernation as he often does after a big defeat. He grew a stubble, put on weight, and started looking like a combination of what his father, Rajiv, and his grandfather, Feroze, would have looked at his age.

He has let his ailing mother stabilize the Congress. He has let his sister Priyanka, with whom time seems to have been kinder than to him, steal the political limelight. He allowed the staunchly secular Congress align with the rabidly communal Shiv Sena to steal power in India's greatest state, Maharashtra. Yes, the tiger (Balasaheb Thackeray) got along well with the lioness (Indira Gandhi), but even they must be rubbing their eyes in disbelief at the coming together of their progeny.

The three-wheeler is chugging along well in Mumbai, under the sagacious leadership of Uddhav Thackeray, his brilliant son Aaditya, the oil being put by Sharad Pawar to grease the axis of evil according to Devendra Fadnavis (the Sena, the NCP, the Congress), whose wife Amruta it seems will have to wait until spring 2025 and not spring 2020 as when she had forecast her husband's return to power, and with Rahul stopping his people in Maharashtra from mouthing off about secularism, CAA and all the other three letter acronyms that you can think of.

Remember, three letter acronyms are never dirty words, it's always the four letter ones that are. But suddenly in India, the three letter ones, 370, CAA, NCR, NPR, etc. appear to have taken a life of their own.

Rahul still is the principal challenger to PM Modi. His mother, Sonia, feels that her poor boy has suffered enough and must take the Congress's helm once again. But has the flick returned to Rahul's flickr...flickr.

Suddenly, India has a crop of leaders to challenge PM Modi in 2024 for the prime minister's role. There's Rahul, there's Didi, there's Uddhav, there's KCR, there's Kejriwal. There are all united in their intense desire to keep the BJP out of power.

The crucial Delhi elections are nigh. AAP, the BJP, and the Congress are locked in a three-way contest. But AAP and the Congress seem to be pulling punches with each other. It seems that if the BJP doesn't get an outright majority, and if neither of the other parties does, then AAP and the Congress could team up to keep the BJP out of power. It could be Maharashtra all over again. How many states will the BJP keep losing from its grasp? Its hold on India seems to be shrinking spring by Amruta's spring.

The founders framed a wise Constitution dividing powers between the centre and the states, which no one in his right mind has disputed in 70 years. Yes, BJP, you have got the centre, but do you have the periphery? The BJP is looking more and more like the Mughals of circa 1800, who were called the kings of Delhi and no more.

Defeat in 2019 seems to have taught Rahul a valuable lesson. For a politician, power is never poison, the non-pursuit or the lacklustre pursuit of power often is. The Congress and like-minded parties like the Trinamool, the TRS, the AAP, the NCP, the PDP (once again all these three-letter acronyms but never dirty as I promised earlier) are gheraoing the BJP and even parties that don't see eye to eye with the Congress such as the Sena and the AIMIM, a party lead by the erudite Asaduddin Owaisi who can often look unreasonable as when he disparages the RSS chief's Mohan Bhagwat's sage idea of a two-child policy for India.

All three Gandhis-Sonia, Rahul, and Priyanka-have taken their gloves off in attacking PM Modi now, whereas between 2014-19 they seemed somewhat intimidated by him and his meteoric rise to power. Priyanka is doing much of the talking today. Rahul knows its Priyanka that the BJP is mortally afraid of, so he's letting her be her natural self. He seems to have realized that his own natural role is to be the back-room strategist. Has Rahul finally stopped being a tubelight? Has he gone from being flickr....flickr....flick to just being straight-up flick. Team up with the Sena. Flick. Hand over the stage to Priyanka. Flick. Team up with AAP? Flick.

Really, is Rahul a tubelight no more? India's electoral destiny and most importantly, Decision 2024, rests on the answer to this question.",,,
149,,"He accuse the Congress of provoking Muslims to protest against the CAA

Union Minister Ramdas Athawale on Friday alleged that provocative speeches by Congress leaders were responsible for the violence in Delhi, which has so far claimed 42 lives. He was talking to reporters at the press room in the Vidhan Bhavan here, where the Budget session of Maharashtra Legislature is currently on. The Minister of State for Social Justice also alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is in power in Delhi, was involved in the riots. He also accused the Congress of provoking Muslims to protest against the CAA.

""The Congress has been provoking people for several days. It is wrong to mislead Muslims over the CAA. It has to be probed whether the Congress and AAP has a hand in the Delhi violence,"" he said.

""The CAA is meant to provide citizenship to the oppressed people from neighbouring countries and not to take away the citizenship of Indians,"" the Minister added.

Polling will begin at 8am and will end at 6pm on Saturday.

While specific election duties have been given to Delhi Police personnel, the CAPF companies have been deployed to provide security at polling booths and movement of EVMs.

Around 19,000 Home Guards from states like Uttarakhand, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh will also assist the local police in providing security at polling booths, the officials said.

A multi-layered security has been put in place at 21 counting centres and 2,689 polling premises, out of which 545 are ""critical"", they said.

""Delhi Police personnel and para military forces have been deployed at critical booths so that more enforcement and better arrangement can be ensured. Patrolling has also been intensified in those localities,"" said Sharat Kumar Singha, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Election Cell).

Marked by the BJP aggressively pushing the anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh as a poll issue, the AAP hard selling development and the Congress conspicuous by its near absence, the bitter, often divisive campaign for the Delhi assembly elections ended on Thursday.

Additional forces have also been deployed to bolster the security of EVMs, critical booths and counting centres, he said.

Static surveillance teams and flying squads have been deployed and special checking drives are being conducted in vulnerable areas to check any attempt to influence voters by money or muscle power and other unlawful practices, police said.

""EVM transportation drill has been planned in coordination with polling officials. All necessary measures have also been taken, including from the anti-terror angle in vulnerable areas. Senior officers will closely supervise arrangements at the ground level.

""Thorough area domination will be ensured in sensitive and vulnerable areas, and all precautions will be taken to ensure smooth movement of voters to the booths,"" a senor police official said.

Pickets on borders have been strengthened to check transportation of illicit liquor and other contraband. All border areas will be kept under strict vigil by regularly coordinating with counterparts of NCR police, he said.

Also, patrolling on boats in the Yamuna river is being done, he added.

According to police, since the enforcement of Model Code of Conduct, 99,210 litres of illicit liquor, with a market value of Rs 2.72 crore and 774.1 kg drugs with a market value of Rs 4.91 crore have already been seized as part of the special drives.

So far, 504 illegal fire-arms and 730 ammunition have been recovered. Besides, 7,397 licensed weapons have also been deposited as a preventive measure, police said.

Action has been taken against 7,820 people under the Excise Act.

While 5,943 persons have been booked under various sections of CRPC, 1,26,095 persons have been booked under DP Act. Besides, 529 cases have been registered under Defacement Act so far, according to the police.

Police have also issued a public appeal to report and share objectionable messages and other social media messages which violate the poll code.

The counting of votes will be taken on February 11.",,,
151,,"Many Muslim voters said though they were ""anxious"" over some objectionable statements made by the saffon party leaders, they rejected politics over religion.

Voters in Muslim-dominated constituencies of Delhi said they voted on Saturday over the issues of jobs, development, education, health care and civic amenities. Of all constituencies where the community's population can sway the poll results, three witnessed a healthy turnout.

In the run-up to the February 8 polls, there were allegations of religious polarisation with the BJP making the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh its poll plank. Many Muslim voters said though they were ""anxious"" over some objectionable statements made by the saffon party leaders, they rejected politics over religion.

At the close of polling, the top three assembly segments in terms of voter turnout were Mustafabad, Matia Mahal and Seelampur, as per provisional turnout figures provided by the election commission. All these seats have a large Muslim population.

""More than casting a vote in favour of someone, this election is about casting a vote against someone. Against those who believe in politics of religion over politics of work, employment and development,"" said Sarfaraz Khan, a resident of Seelampur, a constituency that witnessed violence in December, days after the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed in Parliament.

As many as five out of 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi have about 50% Muslim population, suggested data shared by political parties. Several residents of these colonies said that they voted for good education, good healthcare and civic amenities such as water, sewer and better roads even as they expressed anxiety over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the idea of a pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Iqbal Ahmed, an embroidery worker in Ballimaran, said he would not vote for ""Hindu-Muslim politics"". ""The most important thing for a common man is development. We want our state government to provide us basic facilities such as electricity, water, education and clean roads and not one that divides people on religious lines,"" he said.

Araish Fateema, a resident of Matia Mahal, said: ""Our choice is clear. We have voted for the party who can provide better future to our children. My daughter studies in a government school and I am very happy with her progress. We don't need leaders who know only about politics on religious lines.""

Praveen Rai, political analyst with the Centre for Study of Developing Societies, said: ""The BJP polemics against anti-CAA protesters at Shaheen Bagh and other places have led to a strong consolidation of Muslim votes against it. They seem to have voted en bloc for AAP in this election. The exit polls predicting a clean sweep for AAP confirms their voting choices.""

In the 2015 polls, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won the Matia Mahal and Seelampur constituencies with margins exceeding 25,000 votes in each. The party, in its second poll outing in the year, also went on to win the Ballimaran and Okhla seats with huge mandates - around 60% and 62.5% vote shares, respectively. However, this year, these two constituencies witnessed very low turnout.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had won the Mustafabad seat with a 35% vote share, benefiting from a split of Muslim votes between AAP and the Congress - they bagged around 32% and 30% votes, respectively, from the constituency. The BJP's Jagdish Pradhan, a Gujjar, is the first non-Muslim MLA since the assembly segment was carved in 2008.

In few Muslim-dominated constituencies, voters anticipated a split in Muslim votes between two parties but found themselves in a fix when asked if they could see a third party could benefit from the potential split.

""It does not seem like the numbers could add up and lead to an unexpected result. The winning candidate is likely to be a Muslim,"" said Mohammad Usman, a resident of Jafarabad in Seelampur.

While both AAP and the Congress have fielded Muslim candidates in the constituency, the BJP's choice is a Hindu face - a strategy the saffron party has followed in all Muslim-dominated constituencies across the city.

However, in neighbouring Mustafabad constituency, Samiuddin Haider did not seem confident about the outcome. He said, ""A split can lead to unexpected results and we have seen that happen last year.""

Most Muslim constituencies in Delhi have some common trends - old-school political leaders with large personal following is one such. In several of them, the parties have fielded political heavyweights - Mateen Ahmed and Parvez Hashmi for the Congress in Seelampur and Okhla, respectively. The AAP's choice for Matia Mahal, Shoaib Iqbal, has been MLA for five terms for three different parties since 1993.

Such factors make calculations difficult in many such Muslim-dominated constituencies, several residents said.",,,
152,,"NEW DELHI: In the end, the 2020 Delhi assembly polls turned out to be Landslide 2.0 in favour of Aam Aadmi Party. And social scientists believe that the victory of Arvind Kejriwal will momentarily stem BJP's raucous political rhetoric.

""The election result is good news for Aam Aadmi Party, people of Delhi and India. If the BJP had succeeded, then this vitriolic campaign of communal hatred would have become a standard template. We are saved from that. The victory has also put some brake on the BJP steamroller which is out to dismantle the republic,"" says social scientist Yogendra Yadav, also a former member of AAP's apex Political Affairs Committee,

Rahul Verma of Centre for Policy Research said that there is now a template emerging to challenge BJP. ""But the good news for BJP-Modi is that the template suggests that the parties have to be on the Centre-Right. None is taking them on over the question of religion and nationalism. In that sense, it is their ideological victory. It moves the fulcrum of ideological contest to Centre-Right,"" he said.

""The voters are also making a distinction between state and center. But how long and far needs to be seen. We have seen that since 2018, a segment of voters who support Modi and BJP during Lok Sabha elections chose opposition parties during state elections. This is an emerging trend, but we don't fully understand the reasons behind it. BJP is facing a difficult time to hold on to states. They need to introspect on strategy to retain or win states,"" Verma said.

Political scientist Imtiaz Ahmad said it would be too early to say if Delhi represents a trend towards decline of Hindutva politics. ""However, it is certain that things may not go smoothly for BJP in Bihar and West Bengal. Modi has opened too many fronts: Kashmir, CAA, NCR, and much would depend on what happens on these fronts. The ST and SC issue too will heat up soon. If Muslims, Dalits and Sikhs come together Hindutva politics may run into difficulty,"" Ahmad said.

A former member of AAP's apex Political Affairs Committee, Yadav said that AAP fought a difficult election coming back from a complete reversal in the Lok Sabha polls and managed a remarkable comeback in the face of a very aggressive BJP campaign and a docile EC. At the same time, it would be wrong to see this as a new model of governance or a new type of politics.

Yadav, now president, Swaraj India party, said that the performance of the AAP government was ""moderate"" with ""focus on some visible delivery, without paying much attention to the rest"".

But he also pointed out that ""the formula has been used previously by Naveen Patnaik in Odisha, Nitish Kumar in Bihar, Modi when he was Gujarat CM and Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh. AAP also had a very powerful communication machine, a fairly-organised electoral machine and rode on a personality cult. Instead of changing the rules of the game, the new entrant has learnt the existing rules better than the older players.""

Verma said that AAP smartly steered clear from the ideological planks of the BJP and kept the campaign very local. ""BJP did not have a state-level leadership to match Kejriwal's personality and charisma. And Kejriwal, for his own good, avoided a direct 'personality' contest with PM Modi,"" he said.

""AAP could now be in a good position to make a comeback in Punjab, which is due for polls in 2022. If they manage to do so, they can emerge as an important pole at the national level,"" he said.

Ahmad said that BJP neither had ""a leader with a strong base in Delhi"" nor any blueprint for the capital. ""It chose instead to try to polarise through focussing on Hindu-Muslim issue. The language used by the BJP leaders put off people, especially Muslims and moderate Hindus. On the contrary, AAP focused throughout on a development agenda. Its performance over the past five years, particularly water, electricity and mohalla clinics had made a good impact on people. In a nutshell AAP performance helped it greatly.""

Congress received a mere 4.2% of the votes. In 2015, it had earned 9.7 of the votes. In 2013, Congress had got 24.6% votes. Many reasons have been attributed to the party's precipitous slide.

Yadav said he did not attribute the fall in Congress votes to the party's electoral strategy or campaign. ""The Congress didn't have much to present to the people: a leader, a plan, a manifesto or a strategy. It is the Delhi voters' who decided that in Lok Sabha, it is BJP vs Cong and in the assembly polls, BJP vs AAP,"" he said.",,,
153,,"The heated Delhi assembly election campaign and protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act have combined to create a restive air in the country's capital. BJP, desperate to wrest Delhi from the Aam Aadmi Party has run a provocative campaign labelling its opponents as anti-nationals. While home minister Amit Shah is leading a typical hardline campaign by foregrounding the CAA, nationalism and AAP's ambivalence towards the Shaheen Bagh protests, others like UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union minister of state Anurag Thakur and local MP Parvesh Sahib Verma have exceeded limits and made hate speeches.

As if on cue from such speeches, the area around Shaheen Bagh, where protests have now crossed 50 days, has seen three shootings in four days. Delhi Police's inept handling -- cutting a sorry figure during the first shooting incident by an alleged juvenile -- appears to have emboldened more fringe elements. The police, already facing flak for failing to stop the attack on teachers and students in JNU or take penal action afterwards, cannot afford to let the situation slide any further.

To prevent a more serious situation from developing heads have to roll but Delhi top cop Amulya Patnaik, who has had a forgettable stint, has been granted an extension. Elections are a time for people to assess the work done by their government over the past five years. Political violence, especially during elections, is dangerous because it sows the seeds of fear in voters, undermines democracy and distracts from real issues. BJP didn't really try to sharpen its attack on AAP's developmental claims after making initial efforts. Time will tell whether this was a mistake or not.

Addressing an anti-CAA protest in Karnataka , Owaisi said: ""Firqa Parasti (fascism) in the country has increased to such an extent that if an election has to be won, let it be Congress or AAP or BJP, they try to prove who is the bigger Hindu. While BJP takes Ram's name, AAP takes Hanuman's name and a Congress leader claims he is Shiv bhakt.""

Criticising Congress leader Rahul Gandhi without naming him, Owaisi said, ""The Congress leader will become 50 years old soon, but he is still youth. If he is youth, I am forever young. Only my beard is white, but my heart is young. This Congress leader claims himself to be a Shiv bhakt.""

The Hyderabad MP recalled Godhra massacre case. He said that people who killed innocents have been granted bail, and an innocent school principal has been jailed on sedition charges. Owaisi was referring to the bail granted to convicts in Sardarpur riot case of 2002 (post-Godhra), and a school principal in Bidar being booked under sedition charges in January after students staged a anti-CAA play at the school.",,,
155,,"NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) campaign for the February 8 assembly polls has turned vitriolic with West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma warning people in the Capital that those gathering at southeast Delhi's Shaheen Bagh for the anti-CAA protest will ""enter your houses, rape sisters and daughters and kill them"".

In an interview to a news agency, he added that the protesters would be cleared in an hour if the BJP comes to office in Delhi.

The statement followed controversies in which junior finance minister Anurag Thakur and BJP's Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra find themselves embroiled.

BJP's campaign makes Shaheen Bagh focal point, links it with security threat

With just 10 days to go for the assembly polls, these statements by BJP functionaries are being seen as an attempt to polarise voters. The Shaheen Bagh protest is now being referred to by every party functionary addressing public meetings or press conferences in Delhi.

A large number of women have been protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act -- which promises citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh -- demanding a rollback. An arterial road, which connects Noida with south Delhi, is now blocked due to the protest, causing a lot of hardship to commuters.

Verma alleged that attempts were being made to spread ' jihaad' in all parts of the city. ""Lakhs of people gather there (Shaheen Bagh)...They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. There's time today (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji and Amit Shah won't come to save you tomorrow,"" Verma told the news agency.

Speaking at an election rally a day before, he had emphasised that if BJP comes to office on February 11, the protesters would be cleared within an hour and all mosques built on government land would be razed. Defending his statement, Verma later told Times Now that the protesters were being supported by the AAP government and they will immediately vacate the stretch once the saffron party assumes office. He also drew a parallel between the Shaheen Bagh protest and the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Verma said he feared that a similar ""fire"" may soon spread in the capital.

Earlier, Union home minister Amit Shah, who kicked off the party's poll campaign with a public meeting in southwest Delhi's Matiala on January 23, connected the protest with the security of Delhi, alleging that it was being supported by AAP in Delhi. On Monday, his cabinet colleague, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said the protest was a ""textbook case of a few hundred people trying to suppress the silent majority"". He also claimed that the protest was against Prime Minister Modi and those who were trying to ""fragment"" India were getting cover there.

A senior party functionary confirmed that BJP's poll campaign in the next few days will revolve around ""nationalism"" and turn more ""hardline"". He said CAA, Ram Temple and abrogation of Article 370 will feature in all election rallies with special focus on Shaheen Bagh.

Days earlier, Kapil Mishra had drawn a parallel between the Delhi assembly polls and India-Pakistan contest. ""Pakistan is entering through Shaheen Bagh, and mini-Pakistans are being created in Delhi...Shaheen Bagh, Chand Bagh, Inderlok,"" he had tweeted in Hindi but later deleted it following a rap from the Election Commission.

Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, Mishra alleged that Shaheen Bagh was a ""creation"" of AAP and Congress. ""When BJP reacted to it, it backfired on them. BJP ran a massive campaign on local Delhi issues -- pollution, contaminated water, poor public transport -- but it was forced to react to it. Public sentiment on this issue was very high and people were really angry about it (Shaheen Bagh protest),"" he said, adding that this election was being fought on a 20% (Muslim) vote bank and 80% (Hindu majority). ""AAP and Congress were doing politics of 20% vote bank and taking 80% population for granted,"" he added.

Echoing the sentiments of his party colleagues, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari alleged that a section of people was trying to create hatred and disturb harmony ahead of the polls. ""Slogans are being raised at Shaheen Bagh that Modi and Shah will be killed and they want ' Jinnah wali azaadi'. This is dangerous,"" Tiwari said. ""Keeping Delhi secure is important and that is why this has become an election issue.""",,,
156,,"NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has scored a hatrick in the Delhi assembly election and is all set to form the government for the third consecutive term in the national capital.

AAP breached the high octane campaign launched by BJP that was led by home minister Amit Shah who raked up national issues and the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act, making it a ""Shaheen Bagh versus all"" contest.

Kejriwal, in contrast, confined his campaign to the achievements of the AAP government in the last five years. He made the BJP's frontal attack on him as Delhi voters versus BJP.

Finally, AAP emerged victorious, almost repeating its 2015 performance. These are the seven reasons behind Kejriwal's victory:

Check on private school fee

The Arvind Kejriwal government's decisions in the education sector have perhaps played the most important role in AAP's victory.

With many families in the national capital having school-going children, the Kejriwal government's moves touched their lives in one way or the other.

In a major public-friendly decision, the AAP government did not allow the 200-odd private unaided schools to arbitrarily hike fees in the last five years.

The schools even moved the Delhi high court against the government's decision. The single judge quashed the government's circular in March last year. The government challenged the order. In a major relief to the parents, the division bench put a stay on the interim fee hike.

While campaigning for the Delhi assembly election, Kejriwal on January 19 said his government would continue to check the school fee like they did in the last five years.

In a tweet posted in Hindi, he said, ""As long as there is an honest government in Delhi, the parents need not to worry about school fees. No private school in Delhi will be allowed to hike fees arbitrarily. Like the last five years, we will continue to check the fees.""

The Kejriwal government even forced schools to roll back fees and return the excess amount to the parents if it found irregularities in fee hike.

Upgrading government schools

The AAP govt in Delhi brought unprecedented changes in government schools - right from infrastructure to teachers' training to paying more attention to interaction with parents. No wonder Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the portfolio of education minister, have major claims to make.

Kejriwal said, ""We have ensured that our government schools are at least as good if not better than the private schools. About 25 per cent of Delhi's annual budget has been invested in education in the past three-and-a-half years... The budget for the sector is three times more than what it was when we came to power. With these funds, our schools today have world class infrastructure with SMART classes, swimming pools, classroom libraries, modern desks and better laboratories.""

Kejriwal also claimed that several parents had shifted their children from private schools to the government schools. The teachers and school leaders were given opportunities to learn from some of the most prestigious universities across the world, including University of Cambridge, University of Harvard and NIE Singapore, among others.

Sisodia, meanwhile said Delhi's government schools had outperformed private schools in the CBSE 12 standard examinations.

In its manifesto, AAP claims to have added 20,000 new classrooms in over 200 government schools in Delhi. All previous governments in the national capital had managed to build 17,000 classrooms in all these years.

An interesting aspect of the education reforms is the strict implementation of PTM (parents-teacher meeting). Earlier, PTM was only on paper. However, the Kejriwal government implemented it in 2016, giving a sense of pride and satisfaction to the parents who for the first time started getting feedback on their children's development from teachers.

Free electricity and water

The AAP government gave subsidised electricity to Delhi residents six months ago. On August 1 last year, Kejriwal announced 100 per cent subsidy to those who consume up to 200 units of electricity. Consumers of 201-400 units of electricity started receiving approximately 50 per cent subsidy.

""People used to pay Rs 622 for 200 units of electricity till yesterday, now it's free. For 250 units they used to pay Rs 800, now they'll pay Rs 252. For 300 units, they used to pay Rs 971, now they'll pay Rs 526. For 400 units, they used to pay Rs 1320, now they'll pay Rs 1075,"" he added.

AAP also fulfilled its promise of supplying free water upto 20,000 litres per household per month. In December 2017, the Delhi Jal Board hiked water charges for families consuming more than 20,000 liters of water per month. These families pay Rs 28 per litre extra every month or 85 paise per day. However, for families consuming 20,000 litres, water was kept free of cost.

Mohalla clinics

To offer cheap and quality health facilities to the people, the Kejriwal government had promised to put in place a network of 1,000 mohalla clinics under the neighbourhood health facility scheme. However, it could open only 301 such clinics.

The clinics offer free basic medical care services for common illnesses like fever, diarrhoea, skin problems, respiratory problems, first aid for injuries and burns, dressing of minor wounds and referral services.

While dispensing free medicines and check-ups, it also allows 212 tests by the empanelled laboratories.

Mohalla clinics earned praise globally. World leaders such as former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and former WHO director general Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland hailed the project.

Free DTC bus ride

The Kejriwal government extended free rides in Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses from October 29 - more than three months before the assembly election. The bus conductors distribute Rs 10 pink tickets to each woman passenger, which allows them to travel for free.

Soft Hindutva

Besides these innovative experiments and subsidies, the Kejriwal government also peddled soft Hindutva in order to wean away a chunk of BJP's voters.

Just a day before voting for the 2015 Delhi assembly election, Jama Masjid Iman Syed Ahmed Bukhari appealed to Muslims to vote for AAP. However, Kejriwal's party declined the offer saying it was against any type of caste and communal politics.

However, Kejriwal haas tried to woo people on religious lines.For instance, he has been regularly seen attending iftar events and sporting a skull cap.

Further, on July 12, Arvind Kejriwal flagged off the first train under the Mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra (Chief Minister's Pilgrimage) scheme. Under the scheme, trains ferry senior citizens to five different routes of religious significance for free. The government bears the entire expenditure, including travel, accommodation, meals and miscellaneous arrangements.

The scheme covers five routes - Delhi-Mathura-Vrindavan-Agra-Fatehpur Sikri-Delhi, Delhi-Haridwar-Rishikesh-Neelkanth-Delhi, Delhi-Ajmer-Pushkar-Delhi, Delhi-Amritsar-Bagha Border-Anandpur Sahib-Delhi and Delhi-Vaishno Devi-Jammu-Delhi.

Besides this, Arvind Kejriwal presented himself as a devotee of Lord Hanuman just a few days before the February 8 assembly election. He sang the Hanuman Chalisa and said it gives him peace of mind.

A day before voting, Kejriwal visited Hanuman Temple in Delhi along with his family members and offered prayers. On the voting day, he was seen sporting a tilak on his forehead.

Kejriwal has also never extended explicit support to the Shaheen Bagh protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Image makeover

Arvind Kejriwal launched a major image makeover in the last couple of years.

Earlier, he was in constant confrontation mode with the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over one issue or another, especially full statehood to Delhi.

He even called Modi ""psychopath and coward"" and had expressed apprehension that Modi and Shah would get him killed.

He strongly opposed the Centre's actions such as demonetisation. He had also demanded proof of the Indian Army's surgical strikes in Pak-occupied Kashmir.

For about three years, Arvind Kejriwal kept complaining that Modi was not allowing him to work.

However, over the last few months, Kejriwal changed tack. The aggression against Modi and Shah became a matter of the past.

Unlike his strong response to issues such as demonetisation and surgical strikes, Kejriwal did not take a strong stand against CAA and NPR. He did not openly support the Shaheen Bagh protesters, neither did he visit the protest site.

Kejriwal also sought to strike an emotional chord with the voters when BJP MP Parvesh Verma called him a terrorist. He narrated how his parents were hurt by that allegation and asked voters to decide if he was their eldest son or a terrorist.

He also sought to garner sympathy by discussing his health problems, saying he takes insulin four times a day as he suffers from acute diabetes. However, he undertook 15 days' hunger strike twice for the country.",,,
157,,"After an eventful first term political startup AAP is seeking votes again on the basis of its governance record, while BJP is going all out to unseat it. Until about mid-2017 AAP and BJP constantly baited each other, as a consequence of which governance had suffered since the structure of authority in the national capital is a divided one. Since then chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appears to have kept his head down, toned down the theatrics and focussed on administration - perhaps out of a realisation that voters will tire of the constant search for enemies and demand results.

It's to his credit that he sees his government's primary job as delivering on education and health - areas that have been traditionally under-emphasised by India's political class. BJP, however, has had plenty of opportunity to dissect Kejriwal's claims and question his purported successes on these and other governance related areas, and it's a little surprising that the principal opposition party hasn't made full use of that opportunity. Rather than Kejriwal's performance BJP has bet big on making the elections a mandate on Shaheen Bagh, even if painting AAP and Shaheen Bagh protesters with the same brush is a bit of a stretch. This has occurred in the midst of hate fuelled shootings, campus violence and gross incompetence in policing.

Kejriwal has kept his distance from the protests and placed the onus for resolution on the Centre, with its control over police and traffic. By supporting Article 370 nullification, opposing CAA, and focussing on work done by his government, AAP has staked out a middle ground in the last couple of years. BJP's campaign, by contrast, places a premium on national security in a local election. This is a novel plank, and it's anybody's guess how Delhi's electorate responds in an assembly election to issues not of local roads, hospitals or plumbing, but of an abstract nationalism that consists of taking on spectral enemies who occasionally morph into the figures of opposition parties and leaders, if not Shaheen Bagh protesters.

BJP's strategy has, for instance, resulted in attempts to characterise Kejriwal as a ""terrorist"". Some have seen in the strategy a way of energising its core cadre while getting out the Hindu vote. If this strategy succeeds, it will have ramifications for future elections as well. We will know by next Tuesday, when results are declared.",,,
158,,"In the first state elections of the new decade, whose outcome will be known on Tuesday, incumbent chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in the face of a strong challenge mounted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

After being witness to a fierce election campaign, nearly 14.79 million registered voters in Delhi will finally get an opportunity to vote on Saturday to choose representatives to 70 assembly segments across the national capital and decide who governs the city-state for the next five years.

In the first state elections of the new decade, whose outcome will be known on Tuesday, incumbent chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in the face of a strong challenge mounted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has sought votes in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The first is the AAP's attempt to replicate its success of the 2015 assembly election -- when it won 67 of the 70 seats -- versus the BJP's effort to replicate its success in the 2019 Lok Sabha election,when it won all seven parliamentary seats in Delhi. The second is the AAP's campaign, which is focused on local governance issues and its track record in the past five years versus the BJP's, which focused on the larger ideological issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, national security, and an effort to project all protesters -- and the AAP -- as ""anti-national"". The third is an effort by the AAP to carve out a multi-religious and multi-class alliance versus the BJP's campaign to consolidate Hindu voters across regions, castes and classes. And the fourth is the question of leadership -- where the CM is not pitted against a local rival but the PM.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said the primary issue in the election will be the work done by his government, but hit out at the rival BJP for trying to change the discourse and make it ""about a Hindu vs Muslim"" issue. ""Ours is the first government in 70 years that is seeking votes entirely on the ground of work done on the development front,"" he told HT in an interview on Wednesday. People have to decide whether they ""opt for the politics of abuse and violence, or politics of development"", he added.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said his party's agenda was development. ""We are talking about Ayushman Bharat for free medical care and PM Awas Yojana to provide housing to people... Non-implementation of these two schemes will be the main reason for AAP's defeat in Delhi,"" Tiwari told HT on Wednesday, adding that party did not endorse the provocative statements of some of its MPs.

Over the last four years, the city has voted distinctly for distinct elections.

During the 2015 elections, the AAP bagged 54% of the vote share in the polls. But its vote share decreased in the next two elections held in the city -- the municipal elections in 2017 and the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. The AAP polled the highest share of votes in 2015; it stood second in the 2017 civic elections, with 26% of the votes, and finished third in five of the seven seats in the 2019 national elections, dropping to 18% of the votes and winning no seat.

On the contrary, both the BJP and the Congress improved in terms of vote share in this period. The BJP polled 56% votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, up from 36% in 2017 and 32% in 2015. In 2019, it had a lead in 65 of the 70 assembly constituencies. The Congress got just 10% of votes in 2015, 21% in 2017 and 23% in 2019.

Political observers believe that this election will significantly depend on whether voting patterns of the Lok Sabha election hold, or whether it reverts to the assembly pattern. A Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)-Lokniti poll conducted during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls showed that only about half of the people who voted for the BJP or the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls would have voted for the same party in case of a snap assembly election. The corresponding figure was 82% for the AAP.

The second variable is the impact of the campaign on the polls.

The AAP -- through government advertisements before the model code of conduct, public interaction programmes, townhall meetings by Kejriwal, hundreds of small corner meetings in Delhi neighbourhoods, dozens of rallies and roadshows, and a strong social media campaign -- has advertised its governance record.

In particular, it has focused on the improvement in government schools, public health systems, provision of electricity and water supply and subsidised rates, and free public transport for women. It has also promised to focus on pollution, provision of clean water and cleanliness in its next term if elected to power.

At the end of last year, the BJP had two key campaign planks. Through a parliamentary legislation, and then an announcement by PM Modi at a rally in Delhi, the party claimed credit for providing ownership documents to four million residents of unauthorised colonies in Delhi.

It also promised ""triple-engine governance"" under Modi, for the BJP would then hold the reins of power at the central, state and local level if elected to power.

But the party's campaign took a turn in the wake of protests against the CAA, particularly in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh area. Led by home minister Amit Shah, the party deployed its Cabinet ministers, MPs, former and current chief ministers, and the cadre of ideological affiliates of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to project the protests as ""anti-national"" in character and which suited Pakistan. It blamed the AAP and the Congress for backing these protests, spreading anarchy and violence, and causing inconvenience to the city's residents.

Commenting on the nature of the campaign, Shakti Sinha,a former bureaucrat who has served in the Delhi government and former director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, said: ""AAP's subsidy policy has huge long-term development costs in terms of forgone investment in infrastructure and sustainability, but has created a huge constituency of beneficiaries. Will the BJP be able to sell its message of nationalism and empowerment? It has stemmed the tide that was flowing against it but would it be enough to bring it to power?""

The third related strand was mobilisation of different segments. The AAP hopes to win the substantial support of the city's Muslim population -- which is influential in close to 10 seats. While the minorities had shifted in large numbers to the Congress in the Lok Sabha election, reports indicate they may consolidate behind AAP for they see it as the party best positioned to defeat the BJP. The AAP also hopes to win the support of the Hindu poor and the lower middle-class, primarily on the ground of having delivered tangible benefits to these segments through its welfare schemes. AAP has also sought to quell the impression, pushed by BJP, that it is against Hindu interests, with Kejriwal reciting the Hanuman Chalisa, going to the Hanuman temple on Friday, and candidates repeatedly emphasising their religious identity -- besides focusing on how the party has promised lessons in patriotism in school curricula and supporting moves such as the nullification of Article 370 that gave Jammu and Kashmir special status.

The BJP, for its part, is hoping to consolidate Hindus -- across different demographic segments, from Punjabis, Banias, Purvanchalis (migrants from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar), and Dalits. This is based on the premise that the largely Muslim-driven protests against CAA would antagonise the majority community.

It is here that the performance of the Congress will also play a role, for if it retains its base of Muslims and the poor, weaning them away from AAP, especially in constituencies where it has put up locally strong candidates, it may benefit the BJP.

""Ultimately, it may boil to how much vote the Congress attracts; the higher it is, the more AAP would suffer,"" Sinha said.

And the final strand is leadership. While AAP's mascot is Kejriwal, the BJP is primarily focusing on Modi as the face of the campaign. While the PM addressed only two rallies, it is his image that adorns the party's hoardings and advertisements. Just as in 2019, when the BJP asked who the opposition had to counter Modi, Kejriwal in 2020 is asking who the BJP has to counter him as the CM.

""Arvind Kejriwal is the pole along which these elections are being fought. The AAP is fighting on Kejriwal's charisma and his governance,"" said Neelanjan Sircar, who is affiliated with Ashoka University and the Centre for Policy Research. ""The BJP has ceded the governance narrative to the AAP, but is trying to paint Kejriwal as inimical to Hindu interests. And the Congress is a shadow of its former self.""

It remains to be seen if the BJP had polarised the electorate enough to pull off a win in Delhi, he added. ""Otherwise, it's advantage AAP.""",,,
159,,"Buried in countless discussions on the failure of hate campaign against Shaheen Bagh and the victory of the Aam Aadmi Party's politics of ""kaam"" has been the actual role of the women of Shaheen Bagh. The Union Home Minister's exhortation to deliver ""electric current"" to Shaheen Bagh, the chanting of ""goli maro"" and the actual attacks by stray shooters, crafting sedition charges against individuals, have contrasted singularly with the pictures of rows of women sitting with children, waving the flag and copies of the Constitution and most of all, dedicated to peaceful protest. The importance of this cannot be underestimated.

Speaking at a panel on the results of the Delhi elections on a television channel, Seshadri Chari, a senior BJP spokesperson, described the communally vituperative campaign of his party as ""not hate politics but strategy"". This is a chilling statement. The problem, however, is not only its questionable morality - an important if not scary issue - but the failure of the strategy.

Clearly, as strategy, it has had its uses. The BJP vote share in the 2020 Delhi elections has been reasonable enough. But it failed to produce a cutting edge precisely because the strategy did not extend beyond the rhetoric of incitement. It was the deliberate commitment to peaceful protest by the women satyagrahis - ordinary mothers, homemakers, youth - that staved off any violent counter-response. Counterfactually speaking, if there had been the slightest hint of violent response, the spiral of violence and communal polarisation would have been uncontrollable. The strategy of hate would then have been unstoppable. It would have upended the politics of ""kaam"".

It may be recalled that the women have carried on despite no acts of solidarity from AAP; instead, they have continuously faced the fear of violent ejection by the police. It is the silent contribution of the Shaheen Bagh women that remains unremarked upon in the high-decibel commentaries on the election results.

It raises a difficult question for the BJP now. It deliberately nationalised the elections. Beginning with the Prime Minister, organised and co-ordinated by the Home Minister and deploying a phalanx of Chief Ministers and over 200 MPs, the BJP campaign has been one of the most communal vituperative ever in the history of India's elections. It has raised questions of national integrity, portraying Shaheen Bagh as a centre of terrorist and anti-national activity - and then going on to associate this unpleasing fiction with AAP. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself has been accused of being a terrorist. The basic elements of this campaign are by no means new. Over time, any opposition to the BJP has been progressively labelled as anti-national. This has provided a momentum of aggression to BJP's nationwide campaigns.

For BJP, Shaheeh Bagh was the testing ground of a new use of communal mobilisation. Within less than a year of its massive general election victory and the apparent success of its strategy of dismembering the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP government has faced the strongest-ever protest that has spread across the entire country on the issue of the CAA-NRC. Most importantly these protests were carried out by the youth of different communities, becoming a platform for voicing dissatisfaction against a governance perceived to be high-handed, regulative of lifestyles and unable to provide jobs.

The Delhi elections provided an opportunity to begin a counter-initiative by the BJP. The BJP-ruled States had put down the protests with an iron hand.

Shaheen Bagh provided an opportunity to initiate an ideological counter-offensive against the protests. Indissociable from the protests against the CAA-NRC which it had given birth to, Shaheen Bagh could be deployed to isolate, marginalise and communalise the protests. The only problem - which finally defeated the BJP strategy - was that it was dominated by women who refused to be provoked.

The unresponsiveness of these women was complemented by the careful distancing of the AAP from the protesters. Both of these put BJP out on a limb. More importantly, it allowed the focus to be put on a positive element, that is, the work done by AAP. If Shaheen Bagh dominated the saffron air waves, it was kaam that was discussed among the ordinary voters on the ground. The laying out of water and sewage pipes, free bus rides to women, the rise of standards in government schools and so on, dominated the agenda. It became so effective that the ground campaigners of the BJP had to take recourse to questioning the wisdom of providing ""freebies"" to the electorate. In short, BJP workers were caught in the self-defeating position of saying that the electorate was unfit for the welfare measures that they have traditionally expected the state to provide.

Where does the BJP go from here? Can it afford to charge with all the vituperation and aggression at its command, like Don Quixote against windmills that refuse to move? For BJP aggressive polarisation has been important for both electoral victory while combining this with establishing the affective and ideological foundations of a future Hindu Rashtra. But if communal polarisation does not work as an issue, what else will the BJP have in its electoral kitty? Delhi has shown that a purely negative campaign of discrediting the agenda of its rivals will not do. Nor can it step back now, for the reputation of its Shah-Modi leadership has been built on its authoritarian stubbornness to defend its positions. There is too much now at stake for the BJP leadership and too little ammunition at its disposal.",,,
160,,"The family of an Intelligence Bureau official, whose body was found in Chand Bagh in Northeast Delhi, has accused AAP?leader Tahir Hussain of killing him.

Poet-politician Kumar Vishvas nudged Union Home Ministry and the Delhi Police after reports emerged that stacks of petrol bombs and chemicals were found at the house of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Tahir Hussain, who has been accused by locals of instigating the violence in Northeast Delhi on Sunday.

""Hey Yudhishthir, you don't get the videos of inflammatory speeches, but can't you see the petrol bombs stacked at this leader's house? An IB official was dragged into the house and killed and the media is showing the evidence, where are you? Give us the answer,"" Vishvas said on Twitter in Hindi. He attached a news clip of a report from Hussain's house and also tagged the Home Ministry in his tweet.

Also?Watch?|?Delhi riots: CM Kejriwal calls for strict action against whoever found guilty

Twenty-six-year-old Intelligence Bureau (IB) official Ankit Sharma's body was found in Chand Bagh in Northeast Delhi - one of the worst affected areas during violence - in a drain. Sharma's family members have accused Hussain of killing him. The AAP leader has, however, denied all the allegations.

The violence broke out on Sunday after those protesting for and against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA clashed with each other in Jafrabad and Maujpur areas of Northeast Delhi. The violence later spread to nearby localities like Chand Bagh, Yamuna Vihar etc.

Sharma, the young IB official, came home from the office and went out to see what us happening when the mob captured him and dragged him into Hussain's house, said his brother Ankur. The protesters, with guns and swords in hands, did not let Ankur and his friends rescue Sharma, said the family.

The locals too claimed that Hussain had instigated the rioters who went on rampage and burnt houses and vehicles in the area.

Though the authorities immediately sprung into action to control the violence, a blame game started between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress and AAP.

The Congress accused the BJP government at the Centre and AAP of doing nothing as the violence spread; the BJP hit back, saying it started because of the inflammatory statements made by Congress and AAP leaders and questioned the selective silence of the two parties.

BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who has been facing fire over his alleged inflammatory remarks hours before the violence broke out, took on AAP and said the party is trying to save Hussain. Mishra had accused Hussain of killing of the IB officer.

Mishra is considered close to Vishvas; he had even backed the poet-politician when he had questioned the party leadership for defeat in 2017 municipal elections.

Vishwas was one of the co-founders of AAP but due to differences with the party's top leadership, especially Kejriwal, had distanced himself from the affairs of the party. He had earlier raised his voice against Kejriwal.",,,
161,,"The recent incident involving an Uber driver deciding to take his passengers to the police station because they were coming from anti-CAA protest and were discussing the same in the vehicle has evoked widespread comment. It is an understandably scary prospect when individual citizens decide to don the role of vigilantes and sit in judgment on what constitutes an anti-national act.

Viewed from the Uber driver's perspective however, it is clear that he thought that he was doing a good thing, something truly noble. In his scheme of things, the people in the car were traitors, anti-nationals bent on dismantling the country. It is possible, at the risk of being presumptuous, that this was one of the most significant achievements of his life, this willingness to step up for the cause at some risk to his means of livelihood. There might have been some doubt in his mind about what action to take, and by his own admission, he contemplated a far worse fate than merely taking them to a police station, but he hadn't the slightest doubt that he was in the right. That the party in government and responsible for the maintenance of a rule of law chose to felicitate him would only crystallise this belief.

This is true of many of those who are willing to commit acts of violence in the name of the nation or in the defence of their religion. For most of them, it is not a self-serving pursuit involving any significant material gain. There would be those that are cynically and knowingly manipulating the truth for political ends, as also those that have a commercial interest in toeing this line, but there is large mass of supporters that are true believers. The strength of this belief can even make them willingly accept an obvious lie as the truth; since they know the larger truth, the smaller lie is deemed inconsequential.

All around the country, a virulent form of nationalism is being weaponised, and more importantly being internalised as a duty. Media is playing a huge role in normalising this. In his statement framing the results of the Delhi exit polls, a leading TV anchor described the citizens of Delhi who seemed set on voting for the AAP as having no

interest in issue like the abrogation of Article 370, nor in the CAA and were thus not interested in safeguarding the interests of the nation. To his mind, the entire population of Delhi was treacherous because in a state election, they apparently chose to vote for the party that offered a better everyday life in concrete and measurable terms. Some might have thought of it as the BJP's failure, but to this gentleman it was clear than an entire city had turned rogue.

Till a little while back, we had dog whistles of many kinds- sly and artful references that cast Muslims and liberals as anti-national, now we have blaring foghorns. It becomes possible to characterise a gathering of women and children in the heart of the capital, a gathering that has stayed resolutely peaceful in the wake of many provocations, as being the nerve centre of a terrorist plot. Just uttering the name Shaheen Bagh is enough, for it evokes images that need not adhere to or derive from any form of reality.

While it is true that the role of media in normalising this discourse cannot be overstated, it would be delusional to believe that nationalism does not work at a much deeper level. The appeal of nationalism, particularly among the young, needs to be better understood. Given the economic situation of the country and the looming crisis of employment, there is a growing anxiety and a simmering sense of anger that is looking for an address, a destination that it can direct itself at. One would have thought that the most likely target of this anger should have been the government, which is the primary agent responsible of ensuring that it is creating enough jobs. But the BJP's success has been in making nationalism a much more pressing and immediate issue than issues that would otherwise have been considered pressing and immediate- the small matter of findings jobs, earning good livelihoods and meeting the many aspirations that have been activated in post-reform India. All of us look for our basic needs to be met but we also look for a sense of purpose, and as an assurance that we are significant and that our actions count for something and this is what the ruling party is so effectively speaking to.

To find meaningful employment is difficult, but to be an activist for a right-wing nationalistic cause is so easy. All that one needs to do is settle back into an identity that one was born with. It needs no additional effort, no striving of any kind, and little risk. One is part of the dominant majority, one has numbers and the backing of the state on one's side, which will protect you if do commit any acts of violence. One can simply by deciding to become part of the movement, exercise real power over one's immediate surroundings. One also experiences a heady sense of belonging, an elevating feeling of being part of some martial mission to cleanse the country of its ills. Those that oppose this, are by definition the enemy. And as everyone who is right-minded knows, it is the majority that is under threat, and that its actions are pro-actively defensive. As a prominent ruling party leader has asserted, if we don't beat back the minority today, Mughal Raj is not far from coming.

The change is real and is likely to be irreversible. For a lot of Indians, the case has been closed. The lines have been drawn. Hate is not a choice, but a duty. And it gives hope, succour and a true sense of purpose to people who think of themselves as good and righteous human beings.",,,
162,,"NEW DELHI: After addressing three-four rallies a day other than roadshows, Union home minister Amit Shah holds meetings with constituency coordinators for the Delhi elections till around 2am in the state party office, receiving feedback about campaign and the party's prospects.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking a back seat after an initial rally that made headlines for his assertion that a nationwide national register of citizens had not been discussed in government, Shah has taken charge of the Delhi campaign, virtually becoming its face. This marks a significant change from the pattern since late 2013 when Modi led the party into battles with Shah, as the BJP chief, playing an able deputy.

Delhi elections 2020 news live

While whether Modi will enter the campaign fray in the last few days remains to be seen, Shah taking the pilot's seat has occasioned surprise and has set tongues wagging. The Union home minister's intense engagement has also boosted the campaign, which had at the time of the announcement of the election schedule seemed floundering. It has raised the morale of the cadre.

A tireless campaigner, Shah has been addressing rallies in constituencies bringing about a connect with the voter, which perhaps may not be forged by the large rallies addressed by the PM.

He not only tweets, but also monitors the party tweets and interacts directly with ""cyber warriors"" deployed at several levels to counter opposition -- mainly AAP -- campaign.

Giving the campaign a higher profile, Shah will address a joint rally with JD(U) president and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar in Burari on February 2. The absence of big rallies and the PM's participation has sparked speculation whether the perceived upper hand of AAP has been a deterrent as Modi had led the way in all assembly elections since 2014. In the meanwhile, Shah has immersed himself, making the stakes of the BJP top brass evident.

Shah's combative ""all in"" style and sharp references to AAP's efforts to skirt issues like Shaheen Bagh as well as his aggressive questioning of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's record has given the BJP campaign a bounce. How far it goes remains to be seen though it has forced Kejriwal and senior AAP member Manish Sisodia to respond to BJP's charges. The stage may be set, BJP sources said, for Modi to address rallies after the Union Budget presentation. ""One rally of the PM will be held in east Delhi at Karkardooma on February 3. The other rally will be in Dwarka on February 4,"" a party member said.

""After completing official assignments, Shah moves to the campaign trail, holding at least three-four meetings and roadshows almost each day,"" said a party functionary, who has been accompanying the minister. He said the party strategy meetings start late evening and conclude well past midnight.

Shah's involvement in Delhi polls reminds of his campaigning in Gujarat and Karnataka polls in which he had campaigned and spent time with party cadres. As the party has planned hundreds of corner meetings, Shah will take centre stage, possibly addressing another 30-odd big and small meetings.

""He is addressing rallies with a crowd from 5,000 to 50,000 not caring about the size of the venue and area,"" a party functionary said. Even on Republic Day, Shah took out a roadshow in minority-dominated Ghonda assembly constituency, which the party said evoked a good response. Party members say Shah's strategy has been to attack Kejriwal, highlight the performance of the Centre and accuse the opposition of ""appeasement"" politics in context of Shaheen Bagh and anti-CAA protests. ""Apparently BJP feels that Congress is not in a contest on more than six-seven seats,"" a functionary said.",,,
163,,"AAP leader criticises Yogi Adityanath's 'death wish' remarks on CAA violence

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleged on Thursday that the BJP-led dispensation at the Centre did not have any intention to put an end to the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest at Shaheen Bagh here, saying ""it suits the government in pursuing its polarising agenda"".

""The Delhi Police is under the Central government and they do not want to solve the Shaheen Bagh protest. They want to polarise the society as it helps their politics,"" AAP leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh told The Hindu. He also said that the BJP wanted to divert the attention from real issues such as unemployment and poor financial situation of the country using the CAA.

AAP also hit out at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, saying he should decide whether he stood for justice or in support of rapists.

""If the Narendra Modi government was serious about ending the Shaheen Bagh protest, it would have followed up on the assurance given by its law minister on taking the path of dialogue and honest engagement with the anti-CAA protesters. It suits the Modi government that the protest continues because it indirectly helps it in pursuing its agenda of polarisation,"" Mr. Singh said at Aligarh Muslim University here, earlier in the day.

He alleged that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's statements showed ""his prejudiced mind"" against the AMU. ""The Chief Minister seems to be totally unaware of the AMU's contribution to the country and his outburst is a result of this ignorance,"" Mr. Singh said, adding that the utterances of Mr. Adityanath suggested that ""he is losing his mental balance"".

Mr. Adityanath defended the State police on Wednesday over the deaths of anti-CAA protesters, saying they were shot by other rioters and nothing could be done to save someone with a ""death wish"". Wrapping up the discussion on the Governor's address in the State Assembly, he said the role of the police in dealing with rioters during the CAA protests should be appreciated.

Mr. Adityanath said his government supported democratic protests but would maintain law and order by dealing strictly with those indulging in violence.

Mr. Singh alleged that instead of focusing on good governance and improving law and order in the State, Mr. Adityanath was trying to divert the attention of the public. Under Mr. Adityanath, U.P. was becoming notorious for ""rapists"", he said.. He denied that his party was strategically tilting towards a ""soft Hindutva"" policy to present itself as a national alternative to the ruling BJP.

Referring to the AAP government's policy on the NPR, he said, ""We are looking into certain additional information that is being sought this time under the revised format.""",,,
164,,"Shaheen Bagh protest has been making the news for over two months now. Petitions had been filed in the Supreme Court (SC) against the illegal occupation of the road by the protesters that resulted in denial of the road to lakhs of commuters daily. The petitioners prayed for eviction of protesters from the road. The court finally heard the petition and constituted a three-member team to negotiate with protesters and reason with them to clear the road for traffic. The court held their right to protest as long as it was carried out at designated sites and not on public roads.

In a democracy like India, it is government's responsibility to take executive action while the courts, as guardians of the constitution, can only pronounce on validity and correctness of actions of the government in case the same are challenged by any citizen. The petition for eviction of protesters from the road is primarily an executive action and therefore one is surprised that SC even agreed to hear it. In all fairness it should not have been entertained by the honorable court and petitioner should have been directed to approach the government for evicting the protesters. Instead the court has taken on itself the mantle for executive action by constituting a three-member team to negotiate with protesters. This, perhaps is a wrong precedent that may invite misuse in years to come. Will mediation prove successful? In all probability it will not. In that case what will be the next step by SC? The court has already indicated that denial of usage of road to public is wrong. So, does SC have any other option but to ask police and other concerned authorities to clear the road by force? A decision that logically should have been arrived at by the government long back.

Shaheen Bagh case is a clear case of mismanagement and shirking of responsibility by police and administration on one hand and political exploitation by all parties on the other keeping in view Delhi's elections. Did central government ask Delhi police not to act since the state police is under the Home Ministry? Afterall BJP did use Shaheen Bagh protest as part of its political campaign to win votes of people who were against the same. Aam Admi Party (AAP) was sympathetic towards the protesters and it wooed Muslim voters successfully. Most other opposition parties too showed varying degree of support for the protest since it was anti BJP in nature and that suited them.

If police had acted at the initial stages itself when the protest started, it would have been a routine matter for them. After all, the same police has managed to keep counter protests by those who are opposed to Shaheen Bagh protest in check. Today, it is an entirely different ball game as this protest has acquired an iconic status across the nation. The protesters have declined Home Minister's offer for their leaders to come and discuss their reservations on CAA. They have even spurned the efforts of SC appointed committee for a negotiation for last two days. Instead they are demanding that either Prime Minister or Home Minister should come to the protest site to discuss with them. They have indicated in no uncertain terms that unless CAA is taken back and an assurance given that there will be no NRC, they would continue to protest and block the road. It appears they are in a mood to defy even the SC.

The moot question here is what is emboldening these Muslim protesters to this extent? Surely a few Muslim women, mostly above sixty years of age, cannot be assumed to have taken over the protest leadership as is being projected by organizers of the protest. Most of these women may have never stepped out of the neighborhood where their homes are located without their menfolk accompanying them. They hardly give the impression of being socially active or highly educated or aware of what is happening in the nation. All that they seem to know is that CAA is anti-Muslim and BJP government is anti-Muslim. If these ladies were genuine leaders and knowledgeable on CAA and NRC who were acting on their own, it is possible they may have accepted Home Minister's invite for discussions. The fact that they did not only proves, what most believe already, that they are just a front. The real master minds of the protest have a larger sinister agenda and they are pushing it from behind these burqa clad ladies. These organizers have neither any desire to enter into any discussions on CAA (or NRC) nor come to the fore for the time being to reveal their identities.

So, what can be the sinister agenda that may be taking shape behind the scenes in Shaheen Bagh? Whatever be its final motive, one thing is certain. The real organizers want violence to erupt at some point of time because a mere peaceful protest, as is going on currently, will not serve their purpose. There are two scenarios that could see the onset of violence. First, if there are counter protests from non-Muslims and they forcefully try to open the road, clashes will take place between the two groups. Next, if police try to evict the protesters forcibly, once again clashes will take place. In both these cases, given the Muslim mindset, it may not be farfetched to assume that the organizers may ensure that a few ladies suffer serious injuries, or even an odd fatality, as that will serve their cause to no end. They may even push a few children to the front lines for a similar effect. Once that happens, it will not take much for protests to spread like wild fire across the nation as most Muslims may take to the streets. In such an eventuality communal clashes will abound and many parts of the country will be up in flames. Involvement of Rohingya Muslims in a big way, in the violence that may ensue, cannot be ruled out. Afterall one part of the sinister agenda of current anti-CAA protests is to ensure that no Rohingya Muslim is deported from India. With these Muslim immigrants present in large numbers in states like Assam, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, this could be a very dangerous game indeed.

Once violence spreads, Muslim leadership, with help pf opposition and other supporters, will blame BJP and central government for atrocities against Muslims and harp on BJP's anti-Muslim stance. In addition, it is likely that they will target Mr Modi and bring back 2002 Gujarat riots into focus once again. He will be blamed for carrying forward the 2002 Gujarat agenda at national level. While all this is happening, there will be some anti-India elements that will try and ferment trouble in Kashmir valley with help from across the border. That will ensure Kashmir is on the boil once again and normalization process comes to a halt. It will not matter to any Muslim that in last five years, it was same Mr Modi and his government that helped them to build toilets in their homes, avail gas subsidies, ensured their financial inclusions by bringing banks within their reach and other such novel schemes aimed at making life more livable for all Indians including them without any bias.

Unfortunately, that is the nature of their society since their allegiance is only to their religion and nothing else.

A disturbed and economically weak India engulfed in communal clashes suits the sinister designs of those Muslims who want to either break India or turn it into an Islamic nation at some point of time in not too distant a future. Veiled threats in this regard have already been heard at the protest site many times in last two months. The only way to defeat this sinister agenda is for India's 85% population to stand together with a strong national leadership that believes India is the homeland for Hindus and those minorities who live in harmony with them. That perhaps is the only way Hindus and these minorities, who have a history of living harmoniously with Hindus, would retain India as their nation while keeping the Muslim minority in check.

It is time for a reality check for Hindus to decide on the future of their country, a land that boasts of Lord Shiva, Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, Gautama Buddha, Mahavira and Guru Nanak. A land that has a history dating back to over 6000 years and has given the world inventions and thoughts like the numeral system including the concept of zero, carburized steel, art of weaving cotton textiles, confirmation of presence of water on moon, unmatched knowledge contained in Upanishads and Vedas, basics of wireless communications, advanced understanding of medicine and surgery, religious tolerance, concept of non-violence, understanding of democracy and importance of gender equality. In short, there is a lot at stake for Hindus and it is time for all, without exception, to stand up for what is right for India and Indians.",,,
165,,"NEW DELHI: Blaming the ruling BJP and the central government for communal violence in the capital, Congress president Sonia Gandhi Wednesday demanded that home minister Amit Shah resign from his post for his ""colossal failure"". She accused the Centre and the state government of AAP of ""deliberate inaction"".

Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters, accompanied by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sonia asked Amit Shah to answer what was he doing for last three days since trouble broke out in the city. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra later led a Congress march to demand Shah's resignation but was stopped midway by the police.

Saying the ""tragic events since Sunday have a history, design and pattern .... a well-planned conspiracy"", she said Delhi assembly elections gave away the plan as ""BJP leaders made inflammatory statements clearly intended to create an atmosphere of fear and hate."" She particularly referred to the recent statement of Delhi BJP leader Kapil Mishra, albeit without naming him, ""who gave an ultimatum of three days to Delhi police and warned that 'after three days, don't tell us anything'.""

Priyanka Gandhi told reporters, ""What BJP leader Kapil Mishra has said is shameful and the government not doing anything is even more shameful.""

Asked if Congress feared that violence could spread to other areas like in Gujarat, Sonia said, ""It is true that we fear that it may spread to other parts. That is why we have spelt out what needs to be done to quell the violence here."" She termed as ""shocking"" the silence of the leadership in central and state governments.

The strong statements came after a hurriedly convened Congress Working Committee met on Wednesday morning to express concern over the violence in northeast Delhi and passed a resolution putting the Centre and the state government led by Arvind Kejriwal in the dock. It slammed the Delhi government for not activating the administration to reach out to people to appeal for peace.

""After reviewing the situation, the CWC is of the firm opinion that what has happened in Delhi is a colossal failure of duty for which the entire responsibility must be borne by the central government and particularly the home minister and calls upon the home minister to tender his resignation immediately,"" the resolution said.

At the CWC meeting, Sonia is learnt to have noted that violence happened a few kilometres away from the home minister's residence and during the US President's visit. In what was a reference to the anti-CAA demonstrations, she said the right to protest was a citizen's right and people were being targeted for holding views different from the ruling party.

""Where was the home minister and what was he doing since last Sunday? Where was the chief minister and what was he doing since last Sunday?"" the CWC resolution asked.

During the discussions, a suggestion that the Centre should be questioned about not deploying the Army was shot down by senior leaders like P Chidambaram and Anand Sharma. It was felt that the demand would give the BJP regime a license to send Army anywhere in future. ""Let us not set this precedent,"" it was argued, according to a leader present in the CWC meeting.

Priyanka told the meeting that the party should be seen on the ground. She said Congress workers should go beyond social media and visit people, visit hospitals if they cannot visit localities.

Congress will meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday and submit a memorandum on Delhi riots. While the party wanted to go to the Rashtrapati Bhavan after the CWC, it was informed that the President was busy with the visit of the Myanmar President.

The CWC called for deployment of adequate security forces, formation of ""mohalla peace committees"" and posting of senior bureaucrats in the districts. ""The CM must be visible in the affected areas and in constant communication with the people,"" it said.",,,
166,,"The real challenge for AAP and its chief will come in other States as and when they decide to take the plunge.

As Arvind Kejriwal took oath as Delhi's Chief Minister for the third time on Sunday, one question that lingered repeeatedly was: what next for him?

Will he expand his politics beyond Delhi? Will the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) once again look at Punjab where it had once flourished but now seems to have disintegrated? Will he foray into other States to acquire the political heft that he needs to project himself as a 'national leader'?

Such questions are asked whenever a political leader achieves a certain amount of success in his/her home turf. For example, when Narendra Modi won Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections for a fourth term in 2012, questions were asked if his next goal would be to lead the nation -- which he eventually did.

Political observers had noted how Mr. Modi had spoken to his fellow Gujarati voters in Hindi, while expressing his gratitude for the love they showered on him and his desire now to contribute towards the nation's growth.

So, has Mr. Kejriwal given any such hints in his speech after taking oath? Apart from expressing his love Delhiites and his desire to work with Mr. Modi for a better Delhi, there were no overt suggestions.

But the clues lie elsewhere -- in the radio messages, delivered in Mr Kejriwal's own voice, where the AAP chief spoke of Bharat Mata's every child getting employed, the sweat and toil of every farmer reaping profits, women feeling secure and so on. In the posters outside AAP headquarters, where it gave out a missed call number to get associated with 'Rashtra Nirman' (Nation Building), a word over which the BJP has almost claimed political patent.

If Lord Ram was an inseparable part of Bharatiya Janata Party's politics, Lord Hanuman is now AAP's mascot. From reciting Mr. Kejriwal reciting Hanuman chalisa to the party distributing calendars with Lord Hanuman's photo at the oath taking ceremony, AAP has developed its cultural symbols to go with its politics.

Analysts have termed this as being a more inclusive 'cultural Hindu' as opposed to hardline Hindutva politics of his rivals.

But this evolution of being a 'cultural Hindu' ensures that Mr. Kejriwal studiously kept out of university campuses -- Jamia Milia Islamia (JMI) and the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) -- that had seen protests and violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and fee hikes. He also stayed away from Shaheen Bagh protestors.

Mr. Kejriwal's opposition to the CAA or support to the JNU came in the form of tweets. As he went about seeking votes on the basis of his government's work in the area of education, public health or public transport, many commentators believed that the AAP chief wanted to avoid 'getting caught' in a polarising narrative or being labelled as part of the 'tukde tukde gang'.

But the strategy seems well beyond the Delhi elections. The AAP chief is laying claim to, if not reclaim, the cultural and religious symbols that endeared his rivals to the majority Hindu community, a tactic that the Congress too adopted in State-specific elections such as Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.

It is in this backdrop that the BJP's attempt to call him a terrorist didn't succeed in Delhi and may not do so nationally.

The real challenge for AAP and its chief will come in other States as and when they decide to take the plunge. Delhi minister Gopal Rai indicated nation-wide recruitment for AAP that neither has a robust organisation nor identifiable leadership outside Delhi.

It's influence in Punjab, the only State outside Delhi where it posed a challenge, too has been in the wane. Though there are rumours that though a sulking Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned as minister from Amarinder Singh government, could be roped in to revive the party in the State.

With the Congress party in a State of disarray, a few young leaders may see a future for themselves in AAP as an alternative platform.

So, the formidable challenge of building a robust pan-India organization will certainly weigh on Mr Kejriwal's mind while answering what next for him and his party.",,,

After giving a video statement on Tuesday, Baisla's father, Gaje Singh, and brother switched off their mobile phones and refused to join the investigation. It was found that the phone from which police had recovered the photographs of Baisla and his father joining AAP had only a handful of numbers saved, mostly belonging to his friends.

Police suspect he was using another phone, which he did not mention during interrogation. Cops has been focusing on the WhatsApp group which he was a part of. The group's details have been retrieved and members who made objectionable statements will be called in for questioning.

Sources said during his questioning on Wednesday, Baisla kept evading questions regarding the reason behind the firing. He kept changing his statement on his association with the group, whose members wanted to act against the anti-CAA protesters. ""His versions are being put on record,"" said a police officer.

Baisla's friend, Sarthak, was arrested and questioned. His statements were found to be contradictory. Baisla was taken to Shaheen Bagh on the route he had travelled to establish his claims.

Cops are trying to establish a conspiracy since Baisla claimed that he had bought the weapon seven years ago, but couldn't identify the seller. He kept changing his statement regarding the identity of the arms dealer. A manhunt has been launched to track down the dealers named by him.

Meanwhile, reacting to the allegations of violating the model code of conduct, a senior police officer said that some facts related to Baisla emerged during the course of investigation.

Exit polls on Saturday predicted an easy win for the AAP, which sought to retain power on development plank, against the BJP that ran an aggressive campaign centred around the issues of anti-CAA protests and nationalism.

Most exit polls also predicted that Congress is unlikely to open its account even this time in Delhi, which it ruled from 1998-2013.

Looking to capture power after 22 years, the BJP had mounted one of the most aggressive campaigns in the Delhi assembly polls, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah leading the saffron charge on its planks of Hindutva and nationalism, and its strident opposition to Shaheen Bagh protests.

The issue often dominated the political discourse during the campaign, with many BJP leaders targeting the ruling AAP, and the Congress, accusing them of ""misleading people"" holding anti-CAA protests in Delhi.

A section of voters on Saturday claimed that the prolonged street agitation demanding revocation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was ""not an issue in the beginning of the campaign"" but ""political parties had slowly turned it into one"".

Ballimaran constituency recorded the highest voter turnout of 71.6 per cent among all the 70 assembly seats in the national capital, while Delhi Cantonment brought up the rear in polling percentage, according to data shared by officials on Sunday.

Okhla constituency recorded 58.84 per cent. Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Nagar fall in Okhla assembly constituency, where hectic polling had taken place till late afternoon.

Shaheen Bagh has been the epicentre of anti-CAA protests in Delhi, running into over 50 days now.

Protesters had taken turns on polling day on Saturday to cast votes to keep the agitation alive.

Seelampur constituency recorded a turnout of 71.2 per cent, according to the data.

The turnout in the 2015 assembly polls stood at 67.47 per cent.

Over 1.47 crore people were eligible to vote in the Delhi polls, including 2,32,815 in the age group of 18-19.

Voters in various categories included males (81,05,236), females (66,80,277), service voters (11,608), third gender voters (869), and senior citizens (aged 80 and above) voters (2,04,830), officials said.",,,

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has said the drubbing that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered in the Delhi Assembly polls is part of a political churn that the country has been witnessing in the recent times.

The party's failure to secure absolute majorities in six Assembly elections in a row was reflective of the changing narrative from communal and nationalist jingoism to livelihood issues that affected large sections in the country, he added.

Delivering the golden jubilee memorial lecture on the theme 'Challenges of Indian Democracy - a contemporary perspective', organised by the Loyola College of Social Sciences, here on Tuesday, Mr. Yechury said the public had realised the need to raise issues that concerned sustenance and livelihood, rather than fall for the trap of communal polarisation that the BJP sought for its success.

While there was virtually no opposition for the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana, the public took up the role to dampen their prospects.

Crediting Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for adopting a clever strategy, Mr. Yechury said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader refused to be drawn into the controversy surrounding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

While there had been undercurrents of caste factors, the victory was a vote that the people of Delhi gave for the work that was done during the last five years.

The CPI(M) leader added that the ongoing agitations against the CAA including the one in Shaheen Bagh was not led by political parties, but by the common populace, particularly the student community.

He also reiterated that the implementation of the NRC would lead to complete chaos in the country.

College manager Sunny Kunnappallil presided over the programme.

Principal Saji P. Jacob and Vice Principal Sabu P. Thomas also spoke.

Lashing out at the Gujarat government for constructing walls to conceal slums ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's visit, Mr. Yechury said it was reflective of the Centre's philosophy of ""eliminating the poor and not poverty"". He cautioned the Narendra Modi-led government that it would be making a fool out of itself by creating a charade of prosperity in the country. ""The walls will display its most inhumane face to the world,"" he said. He added that the U.S. President's visit was in reality a reciprocation to the Modi government's efforts to open the doors for foreign investment in the country.

The CPI(M) leader also questioned the denial of permission for British MP Debbie Abrahams to visit the country.",,,
172,,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Tahir Hussain is under fire after allegations that he is involved in the killing of Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer Ankit Sharma. He has denied the charge.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Tahir Hussain is under fire after allegations that he is involved in the killing of Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer Ankit Sharma. The 26-year-old IB official's body was pulled out of a drain on Wednesday in Chand Bagh area in Northeast Delhi, which has seen worst riots in the last two decades.

The drain is close to Hussain's house and Sharma's family has blamed him of leading the mob to kill the 26-year-old.

Hussain is the councillor from Ward number 59, Nehru Vihar, which comes under Mustafabad assembly constituency in east Delhi and is about seven kilometres from Chand Bagh. He won the municipal election in 2017.

The 42-year-old was the richest candidate in the ward in 2017 municipal elections as he had declared assets worth Rs 16 crore in the affidavit. Of the 13 affidavits analysed by Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR), on average, the candidates from Nehru Vihar own Rs 1 crore in net assets.

Hussain had further said in his affidavit that he is a businessman and there are no criminal cases against him.

The AAP leader has denied any involvement in the riots or Sharma's death. In a Facebook post on Thursday, he said that protesters had broken into his house on February 24, after which he contacted the police and they whisked him and his family away. ""The police then took control of the building. When i returned on February 25, the people in the area started raising slogans against me. The police then advised me to leave the area, and I have not ben to that house since then. I don't know who did what in that house,"" Hussain said in the post in Hindi.

People in the neighbourhood have alleged that Hussain played an active role in the riots that engulfed the area since Sunday. Some unverified videos have gone viral on social media where a man appearing to be Hussain is seen with a stick in his hand, based on which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leader Kapil Mishra have upped the ante against AAP.

The AAP leader had released a video earlier on Thursday in which he rejected allegations against him. ""These are lies and baseless accusations. For our safety, my family and I had moved away from our home on Monday in police presence,"" he said in the video which was released by AAP's social media head Ankit Lal.

""It is wrong to target me. I and my family have nothing to do with it,"" Hussain futher said in the video.

Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said the party's stand remains clear that strictest punishment must be taken against anyone associated with spreading violence and added that Hussain has given his statement on the matter.

173,,"NEW DELHI: A sharpened need for their own security, a shared grief with ""families who lost their sons"" in the northeast Delhi violence and some disappointment that the case was deferred to March 23 marked the first reactions at Shaheen Bagh after Supreme Court said it did not find the climate conducive to proceed on the road-closure case.

""Supreme Court took the decision recognising the circumstances. It had already recognised our right to protest. In the current situation, if only SC had also seen it fit to say something about our own protection,"" said Ritu Kaushik on the 75th day of the women's protest on Thursday.

The report from SC on Wednesday had brought the women to their feet. After a cathartic spell of Delhi Police hai hai and Amit Shah hai hai, the men and women collapsed back into position, grieving the ""riots and attacks"" in northeast Delhi where some have family and friends.

""How many mothers must see sons killed for politicians to gain?"" asked Fatima. From the stage, Amna Faheem tried to calm frayed tempers: ""This fight is not of religion and it will not be allowed to become one despite all efforts. People of all faiths are here and we grieve for all who are shaheed in the violence."" Notably, the elder men were also out, taking to the stage to share animal parables that talk peace and humanity. ""All youth have to be guided.""

Fear in their heart, steel in their eyes and message of peace on their lips, Shaheen Bagh spent Wednesday afternoon in dua, a tentful of people in quiet prayer.

The chatter centred on the lives lost and grieving families. ""The instigators, the ones behind it, will all have to answer god -- call him allah, call him bhagwan.""

Talking of the massive 2019 victory for Modi-led BJP, Bushaira Parveen said: ""Vote dene ka sazaa hai ye? (Is this what we get for voting them?""

The violence came as a body blow. ""This is what they will do? They keep talking population. So, kill some, nullify documents of some, chase people out by destroying their homes and documents and those who are left, keep them under their thumb,"" said a woman, who had returned from visiting the affected families in Jafrabad. ""They should know the public is against riots. That is a fact.""

Kehkeshan Riyaz said: ""One Kapil Mishra wreaked havoc. Imagine how many Kapil Mishras would have been born had the Ayodhya verdict been in our favour.""

After every outburst, they returned to talk of their protest and the necessity to secure the ""sanctuary of peace"". ""What has happened is that their misrule and kala kanoon has brought Hindus and Muslims closer. That they cannot tolerate,"" said Bushaira.

""The plan was to fatigue us out. Let this linger, the women will get tired. The idea is to crush the andolan. We held together through very difficult days, we shall continue,"" said Zia Bano. They are wary for their own security. ""Should we not be given adequate security?"" Shaheen Kauser said, ""Police in places is playing a role in worsening the social fabric,"" but refused to paint all police with the same brush. ""Yahan ki police seem more responsible,"" is the general sentiment.

""We have no expectation from any government now,"" said one, while Kauser added, ""Our only hope lies with Supreme Court."" On AAP government, Riyaz said, ""In our situation, we cannot trust political parties. But we plan to call Amanatullah Khan, our MLA, here and ask him if (CM) Kejriwal will pass a resolution against CAA and announce there will be no NPR.""

Kasganj youth Chandan Gupta was shot dead during a Tiranga Yatra he was leading through a communally sensitive area in the western Uttar Pradesh town on January 26, 2018.

We are a non-violent society and protest should always be peaceful. I have lost my son to one such act of violence,"" Gupta said.

""I support the Citizenship Amendment Act, but violence is not the answer for those who are against the law. In fact, this violent act hampers the government efforts on CAA. His act is not justified on any parameter,"" Chandan's father said.

175,,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched an attack on continuing anti-CAA agitation at Jamia Millia, Shaheen Bagh and other places, saying they marked an effort to disrupt harmony by protesters who were using the tricolour and Constitution to mask their real intent.

He said the protesters' professed allegiance to the Constitution was a deception aimed at distracting attention from the real intent of the conspirators and called upon voters in Delhi to support BJP to stop the anarchy from spreading further.

""Jamia ho ya Shaheen Bagh, pichhle kai dino se, citizenship amendment act ko leke pradarshan hui. Kya ye pradarshan sanyog hai? Ji nahin, ye sanyog nahin, ye prayog hai. Iske pichhe rajniti ka ek aisa design hai, jo rashtra ke sauhadra ko khandit karne ka irada rakhta hai. (Whether it is Jamia or Shaheen Bagh, anti-CAA demonstrations have been going on for the last few days. Are these demonstrations random events? No, they represent a politics that is designed to destroy national harmony),"" said the PM as he asked voters in Delhi to thwart the ""mentality"" which , if not checked, can cause similar blockades elsewhere too.

The PM's aggressive remark came as he addressed his first campaign rally in Delhi and were in sync with BJP's attempt to rally the public opinion against the sit-in at Shaheen Bagh which has gone on for over 50 days now and sparked resentment in adjoining residential areas.

""Look at the huge inconvenience it has been causing to people who commute from Delhi to Noida. People of Delhi are watching. They may be silent. But they are seething with resentment over this display of politics of vote-bank. This mindset has to be checked here itself. For, if the conspirators get powerful, more roads and lanes will be blocked similarly. We cannot allow Delhi to be pushed in the throes of anarchy. We have to stop this and every vote for BJP will help its spread. Only BJP can do that,"" he said in the backdrop of an attempt by the party to blame its rivals AAP and Congress for the Shaheen Bagh blockade.

The focus of PM's attack on Shaheen Bagh, which drew loud cheers from the large crowd, was aimed at undercutting the legitimacy that the protesters have sought to garner by displaying the tricolour and carrying copies of the Constitution. The PM suggested that the display of faith in constitutionality at anti-CAA protest sites was just a stealth tactic. ""Else, they would have heeded the spirit of a series of pronouncements from courts where they have stressed that protests should not result in violence, loss of public property and difficulties to people. After all, courts derive their authority from the very same Constitution,"" he said.

Modi also alleged that AAP and Congress were the reason why the protests have persisted. ""These should have been called off after the government's assurance (that the CAA will not deprive anybody of citizenship and implementation of NRC is not on the table yet) . But AAP and Congress are playing politics and all these things have now been exposed.""

As BJP's aggressive election campaign enters the last leg, Modi sought votes by referring to the central government's initiatives for the country and the city and put spotlight on protests over CAA. Modi will address the second rally in Dwarka on Tuesday.

The PM said Delhi's development will get a major boost after BJP comes to power in Delhi. Delhi will become free of water tankers and get better sanitation. Modi urged people to come out in large numbers and vote for BJP and NDA in Delhi elections. ""Each vote polled for BJP candidates will boost my strength also. Time has come to change Delhi,"" he said adding that in the 21st century only the politics of development will work not politics of hate.

Taking a swipe at Congress and AAP, Modi said those who questioned the Batla House encounter are now saving people who raised 'tukde tukde' slogans. The PM also slammed Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who had raised questions on the surgical strikes carried out by the Army.

Aware that the tans Yamuna area where the rally was held is home to a large number of 1731 unauthorised colonies, Modi listed out the Centre giving ownership rights to over 40 lakh people living in such colonies in different parts of the city. Without naming the AAP government, the PM said it was done despite obstacles being created. The development of these colonies will get a boost after BJP comes to power in Delhi, he said.

The PM said all those living in slums in Delhi will get 'pucca' houses equipped with toilet, gas and electricity connection. In an indirect attack on AAP government which has not implemented Ayushman Bharat Yojna and PM Awas Yojna in Delhi, Modi said they will continue to obstruct welfare projects till they are in power because they know nothing other than politics. Modi touched on national issues like abolition of Article 370, construction of Ram Temple and CAA for giving citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He said the BJP believes in positivity and keeps the national interest supreme.",,,
176,,"Once Delhi Assembly results are out, we can be more sure-footed on it, says an AICC secretary

Of the 29 States, four States have so far passed a resolution rejecting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), a legislation that was cleared by Parliament on December 11.

Kerala was the first one to do so on December 31, followed by Punjab on January 17, Rajasthan on January 25 and West Bengal on January 27. Together these four States send 100 members to Lok Sabha.

Of these, only two are Congress-ruled States.

The Chief Ministers of the other three Congress-ruled States -- Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Puducherry -- have spoken out against the CAA and asserted that the National Register for Citizens will not be extended to their respective States, but a formal resolution against the CAA has not been moved in the Assembly. The official word is that the Budget sessions are scheduled for February in all the three States during which the resolution will be tabled. And there is so far no word from Maharashtra and Jharkhand where the Congress is a junior partner in the government.

The Congress feels that Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand results followed by protests against the CAA, which took the government by surprise, have opened up space for them and started an anti-government narrative which so far was missing. But the party is not sure on how prolonged focus on the CAA/NRC will impact its electoral fortunes.

The insiders say the decision to push tabling the resolution for the Budget session is primarily for two reasons. One there is a growing view in the party that discussions around the CAA has rapidly reduced down to a communal debate. ""Yes, as per our convictions we have to oppose a blatantly unconstitutional law such as CAA but the question we need to answer is does it politically help us. If there is a Hindu-Muslim polarisation on the issue, then BJP will benefit. Also this obliterates any discussion on the economy,"" an AICC secretary said on condition of anonymity.

Second, the party feels that the Delhi Assembly elections, scheduled for February 8, can provide empirical evidence on the public opinion. The party is waiting to see if the BJP drastically improves its tally from the current three seats in the 70-member Assembly based on a campaign solely dependent on the CAA. ""Once the Delhi Assembly results are out, we can be more sure-footed on the CAA,"" the AICC secretary said.

""In Chhattisgarh, the Muslim population is merely 2-3%. Madhya Pradesh also has similar numbers. In both the States, the resolution will eventually be passed but perhaps not with the same urgency like the border States of Rajasthan and Punjab,"" a leader from Chhattisgarh said.

The CAA/NRC protests continue to be led by common citizens. While the Opposition will pick the flag once the citizens' participation wanes, so far it has failed to make a collective and emphatic stance. Five key Opposition parties -- Trinamool Congress, DMK, SP, BSP and AAP failed to attend a meeting organised by the Congress of all the Opposition parties on January 13.",,,
177,,"DMK wants more federalism, less centre interference, less imposition of Hindi, less intrusion of Centre in State's rights.

The AIADMK government has presented a budget without populist schemes. DMK IT wing head and legislator Palanivel Thiagarajan, an ex-banker, contends that populist schemes might come as part of the Chief Minister's announcements and why such announcements under Rule 110 in the Assembly are bad. In an interview with The Hindu on Sunday, he accuses the AIADMK government of managing the economy badly and also talks about his party affairs.

Excerpts:

They have already projected rather massive schemes and grants and subsidies year over year. Just because the man has not announced on what it is going to be used for, it doesn't mean they are not going to do it. I believe these numbers [provided in the TN budget] are just meaningless numbers. The gap between what they said they will do in the budget, what they said they have done in revised estimates and what they end up doing eventually is huge. Even between revised estimate and final account, there has been increase. They would they would have revenue deficit of ?14,000 crore in 2019-20, but in the revised estimate the figures went up to ?25,000 crore. They have perfected the art of funny money accounting.

In the old days, Ministers did their job. But now, Chief Minister has to announce new schemes under Rule 110. I guarantee you that between now and Thursday next, the CM will make some announcements under Rule 110. This is bad not just for democracy but for administration. Bad for administration because it concentrates power on one person. Bad to democracy is the sense, what is the point of having a legislature and a Cabinet. So, I don't yet share your optimism that it is only because of debts, there are no populist schemes.

I am not senior enough in the party that I make policy decisions. My leader would tell the way. But in my professional opinion, as an ex-banker, I think we have to consider some serious restructuring because we have reached a point where the non-discretionary spending - pensions, salary, non-wage operational and maintenance expense and interest rates, has taken up almost 100% of the State's own revenue. That means there is no money left to do anything on your own. But, you cannot cut down on the first three non-discretionary spending, but you can cut down the fourth - interest rates. The cost of interest rates has escalated beyond all measures.

People who do not admit their problems, can't fix their problems. I have been saying since 2016, your biggest problem is the revenue as a percentage on GSDP has dropped dramatically. It has dropped from 14.45% during Thalaivar Kalaignar [M. Karunanidhi]'s rule to 12.67% during Ammaiyar [Jayalalithaa]'s rule to 10.4% during this rule. There are certain expenses you cannot cut out -- pensions, salaries, non-wage operational and maintenance and interest rates.

Just because you corrected your mistake [revoking public exams for Class 5 and 8], you are not me. DMK is for the Special Agriculture Zone but we are asking as to how the government is going to implement it. There are several other issues, in which the AIADMK is on other side. Why didn't they get their alliance party over exempting NEET for Tamil Nadu? DMK wants more federalism, less centre interference, less imposition of Hindi, less intrusion of Centre in State's rights. We are against CAA-NRC-NPR, we are against new educational policy but the AIADMK government doesn't seem to oppose any of these.

It's a deeply personal question. I feel that all powerful people in the world engage specialists as and when required. I have been a consultant for several great organisations. Every person, who has a unique skill, as long as they can add value to an organisation. They come and work for the organisation. Mr. Kishor has worked as a consultant for the BJP. Does it mean that he has shaped Mr. Modi's policies? Such a man should be seen as a professional, who come in as a consultant. Consultants work for all different competitors in the same industry. The reason they are brought in as consultants is that they have a broader view than internal office-bearers.

Mr. Kishor has now clearly developed a particular philosophy. He is pro Constitution, against centralisation, against autocracy, against CAA, NRC and NPC and pro federalism. He has exited JD (U) over CAA.

I am appalled. It is morally reprehensible. I am a Hindu and I have faith. And I think a true Hindu would not thrust his belief on others and in fact would defend others' faith as his own. The BJP is doing politics by dividing people based on religion. I think that is vile and uncouth and in fact, un-Hindu. My grandfather made the idol in Swamimalai and donated it to Sabaraimala. The DMK through its thiruppanis while in government has done more service to Hinduism that all Brahmins combined. I have done more to Hinduism that Mr. Ganesan and H. Raja combined.

The CAA is not a complicated law. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said ""Aap chronology samajh lijiye [You all please understand the chronology - to say that the CAB will come and then the NRC]"". Either Mr. Udhayakumar is genuinely unaware of the CAA or he is playing petty politics. Let Mr. Udhayakumar print pamphlets over CAA and carry out a campaign in support of the CAA or let him explain what Mr. Shah has said will not happen at all.",,,

Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha on Wednesday showered praises at Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who led the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to a stunning victory in the Delhi elections for the second time in a row. Sinha, who had exited the BJP to shift to the Congress ahead of last year's national elections, referred to Kejriwal as a ""super leader"" in six tweets.

""Many Congratulations to the super leader #ArvindKejriwal, #AAP & his entire team for the spectacular, grand victory in the #DelhiElections2020. The writing on the wall was absolutely clear, despite many obstacles, propaganda, man & obvious money power of the opponents,"" said Sinha in one of the tweets.

Sinha also didn't miss the opportunity to take a swipe at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), though indirectly, that had led an aggressive campaign against the AAP and was Kejriwal's prime rivals in the national capital. ""Jinhe naaz hai hind par, aab woh kahan hai? (Where are those who say we are proud Indians?)"" he said. But before signing off, Sinha made it clear that the comment in this tweet is in his personal capacity. The line was written by poet-lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi and used in filmmaker Guru Dutt's Pyasa. It has also been prominently displayed by those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

He also congratulated the Kejriwal family, saying the election victory is the best birthday gift for Arvind Kejriwal's wife Sunita, and Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who retained his Patparganj seat in a closely-fought contest.

""This victory has proved that negative, hatred & vendetta politics doesn't work, only service to society helps to achieve success. Best wishes especially to Deputy CM #ManishSisodia, our friend, brother, confident & sharp spokesperson #SanjaySingh, #RaghavChadha, #AtishiMarlena, #Ashutosh, well wishers, workers & supporters. Once again, good wishes to a leader with a personality in totality #ArvindKejriwal & belated warm birthday wishes to Mrs. Kejriwal & love to their beautiful children,"" said Sinha.

Sinha's disclaimer came against the background of criticism in sections of the Congress over its drubbing in the Assembly elections. The party couldn't win a single seat, scoring a duck for the second time in Delhi.

Many leaders have called for action, rather than introspection. Senior Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee even attacked fellow party leader P Chidambaram for showering praises on AAP and criticising the BJP. ""With due respect sir, just want to know- has @INCIndia outsourced the task of defeating BJP to state parties? If not, then why r we gloating over AAP victory rather than being concerned abt our drubbing? And if 'yes', then we (PCCs) might as well close shop!"" Mukherjee said on Twitter.

Sinha was the BJP's in-house critic for years before joining the Congress last year. Also called Shotgun for his piercing comments, Sinha has been targeting the BJP for months.

The former Patna Sahib lawmaker finally exited the BJP last year before the national elections when the BJP decided to field law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from the seat.

Gandhi reminded that the Congress was the original architect of the pan-Indian tax, which will replace myriad of local levies, and quipped, Unlike demonetisation, GST is a reform that @INCIndia has championed & backed from the beginning. But like demonetisation, GST is being executed by an incompetent &insensitive Govt w/o planning foresight &institutional readiness, he said.

Earlier, special excise duty was charged on textile but only on dispatching of fabric by manufacturers. Moreover, most dealings are done manually, and people dont have access to computers. They dont know how GST needs to be implemented. This could create problems in compliance. At Sadar Bazar, the largest wholesale market in the capital, there were a few first-day hiccups. Some traders said they were still waiting for their GST identification number, while others  who have never used a computer  said they were grappling with the new software. I am not quite sure how this software works. I have never used a computer before because I would use books to keep records. I am 67 now; its tough for me to learn all of this, said Somesh Jain of Jain Traders, which deals in wholesale plastic work. Some chemists in Delhi expressed uncertainty about the impact it would have on business. We have decided to first finish what we have left and have stopped billing for the time being. We have not called for fresh stock right now, said a chemist at Batra Medicos in Saket. Many restaurants and bars shut early on Friday, while others said they introduced the new rules after midnight. Take, for instance, Hard Rock Cafe, which remains open till 1 am. New rules and rates were applied from today morning. For customers who were there post 12 am, we took the decision to clear their bills before midnight. So, we let them sit till after midnight, but they were charged the old rates before GST was to come into effect. We think our revenue will increase because more people will come since taxes have reduced, said Suresh Kumar, manager of the Saket Branch. Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Manish Sisodia has expressed some apprehensions over the hurry in implementation of GST. A government official maintained, Prices, we feel, might go up in many cases and that is not what was envisioned. We hope the confusion clears in the coming days, and we are doing all we can for it.",,,
182,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday dubbed the overall of Indias tax system through a unified goods and services tax (GST )as a good and simple tax which will end the harassment of traders and small businesses while integrating India into one market with one tax rate. At a midnight event to launch the Goods and Services Tax (GST) at the historic central hall of Parliament, Modi said the indirect tax reform is a result of combined efforts of various political parties at different points of time. Today, the GST council met for the 18th time. It is significant that the Gita has 18 parts. As far as something seems, as impossible it seems to achieve, it can be obtained through hard work, Modi said, quoting Chanakya. GST, he said, is an example of cooperative federalism as the Centre and states together thrashed out a new law with consensus. Besides being a transparent and fair system that will end generation of black money and corruption, GST will promote new governance culture that will end harassment at the hand of tax officials, the prime minister said in his speech. Touching upon initial teething troubles that may be witnessed as six crore small businesses switch over to an online return filing system, the Prime Minister compared the GST rollout to the process of wearing corrective spectacles. Yes, there are some who are not comfortable with technology. Even if you go to a trusted eye doctor, if your eye power changes, then you still have to adjust for a few days. This (GST) is like that. GST is such a catalyst that will end the imbalance in Indias development. GST, much like our railway, will be run by the centre and the states. For the first time, centre and state officials will work together: Mr. Modi says. Modi also said that GST would eliminate the compounding effects of multi-layered tax system. Tonight, at midnight, we will together move the nation forward. In a little while, the country will move in a new direction. 125 crore people will benefit from this. I dont agree that GST benefits are limited to just the economy. This path we have chosen is not one party or one governments. It is the result of our combined efforts. We have come together tonight at the central hall of parliament,  Modi said. The Congress termed the midnight launch, which was attended by President Pranab Mukherjee, Vice-President Hamid Ansari, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and former prime minister H D Deva Gowda besides various Bollywood stars and industrialists, as tamasha, saying it was being rushed in a half-baked manner as a self- promotional spectacle. In his speech, President Pranab Mukherjee pointed out that the GST launch was a journey that began in 2002. This historic moment is the culmination of a 14-year journey that began in 2002. The introduction of GST is a momentous event for the country and moment of personal satisfaction for me. As part of the empowered committee, I had the opportunity to meet the chief ministers of Gujarat and Maharashtra, among others. I remained confident that GST was only a matter of time. This was justified when on 8 November 2016, I had the opportunity to give assent to the GST legislation. It has pleasantly surprised everybody by completing its task on time, the President said. The government promises that the transition to a single, nationwide tax on goods and services will streamline business and boost the economy by tearing down barriers between 31 states and union territories. It is estimated to add 0.4% to 2%to GDP growth. But some businesses are still figuring out how it will work as they race against time to adopt or upgrade cash registers and computer systems, so they are able to file monthly tax returns to comply with the new regime.",,,
183,,"On any routine day, it could have been a fine routine lunch and chit-chat time at little over 2 PM at the Income Tax building on Main Road in the city. But implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in another 10 hours is what has kept all the staff of newly bifurcated GST wing in the building on their toes. Everyone is visibly busy setting up systems to files to anything and everything from here to there, so that a working system could be developed or at least on the day GST is launched. Apparently, its not only traders on roads and in their shops who claim not to be ready for new tax regime on their part, but even government officials appear to be as busy if not less as any bank employee on November 10 last year, the day when bank branches opened for the first time after demonetization. The situation is almost the same here. You can see everyone busy doing at least one thing or the other, and we have been working tirelessly here in the building since some time. We want to leave no stone unturned from our part of preparedness, as there are people on the other side of the road already accusingly claiming that even government officials are not ready, said an official who has been recently transferred to GST wing. It is true that carrying views of friends and follies on both side of shoulders, the government is ready to hammer the bell of GST in existence at Parliament House at sharp 12 Midnight of June 30-July 1. At the same time, it is also true that no one is very much clear what he is going to do in days to come. As far as we are concerned, we have been shifted to Audit wing of GST. But it is going to take at least six months for things to be streamlined and everyone in the system to be familiar with exactly what and how one have to perform his task, said Administrative Officer Anil Kumar, who has been transferred to Audit wing with office at Ashok Nagar-Argora Road. It used to be large tax office earlier. But now that entire GST wing is combined in only two offices for whole Jharkhand, one in Ranchi and another in Jamshedpur, we are going to have three different verticals coming in this office and none of the verticals is clear about their workplace and other things. We are in process of setting up all those things, added Kumar. Meanwhile, ex-Deputy Chief Minister and AJSU Chief Sudesh Mahto has said that the GST was good for traders in State. He, however, added that government needed to listen to the traders problems and help them getting their issues solved.",,,
184,,"While responding to a question in the Lok Sabha on Friday, the government said that it has not studied or assessed the impacts and after-effects of demonetisation. The minister of state for finance, P. Radhakrishnan, responded with a no when asked if the government had studied the impacts of demonetisation on the economy. On November 8, 2016, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the decision to suddenly demonetise notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000. It led to severe hardships suffered by almost the entire population in the country. Modi had argued that a large part of the currency will be returned putting an end to the stock held as black money. Recently, the agriculture ministry hadadmittedto a parliamentary standing committee that demonetisation caused severe hardship for farmers. It said that due to the withdrawal of currency notes, farmers were unable to buy seeds and fertilisers when it was time for them to sow. Indias 263 million farmers live mostly in the cash economy. Millions of farmers were unable to get enough cash to buy seeds and fertilisers for their winter crops. Even bigger landlords faced a problem such as paying daily wages to the farmers and purchasing agriculture needs for growing crops, the ministry had said. However, a week later the agriculture ministrywithdrewthe report and served show cause notices to officers who were responsible for the earlier report. The new report submitted by the agriculture ministry said that demonetisation had caused no adverse impacts on farmers in the country. P. Radhakrishnan also said in his response on Friday that 99.3% of the money in circulation was returned to the RBI. As per data published in Annual Report 2017-18 of the Reserve Bank of India, the total value of Specified Bank Notes (SBNs) in circulation as on November 8, 2016, post verification and reconciliation, was Rs 15,417.93 billion, and the total value of SBNs returned from circulation was Rs 15,310.73 billion, he said.",,,
185,,"With nearly 99% of banned Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes back with the RBI, questions are now being raised about the economic rationale and success of demonetisation, and whether it could hurt the economy not just in the near term but also in the medium term. How do the ground realities compare with some of the stated aims of demonetisation? By withdrawing high-value currency notes, the government had reckoned that those holding unaccounted cash or black money would not deposit it in the banking system, thereby hitting this hoard. The Prime Minister had said it was important to isolate the dishonest. The expectation was that notes worth over Rs 4 lakh crore wouldnt return to the central bank. Now, with 98.96% of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes back, the bottom has been knocked out of that argument. What it indicates is that unaccounted funds could be in forms other than cash, such as realty and gold. Although this was not explicitly mentioned as a major policy objective when demonetisation was announced on November 8, 2016, the government subsequently said that one of the aims was to bring about a shift from a cash-based economy towards more digital or electronic forms of transaction. In the first flush after the withdrawal of high-value notes, with most people short of cash because of restrictions, there was a spurt in electronic transactions  through prepaid wallets, debit and credit cards, NEFT (National Electronic Fund Transfer). From 671.49 million transactions in November last year, it rose to 957.50 million in December at the end of the governments deadline on cash withdrawal. Subsequently, however, electronic transactions headed southwards as the lack of infrastructure started showing, including a shortage of PoS (point of sale) machines, with manufacturers unable to supply a high number of machines in short time as the demand for these soared.",,,
186,,"Demonetisation as a means of tackling the black economy was destined to fail. It was carried out on the incorrect premise that black money means cash. It was thought that if cash was squeezed out, the black economy would be eliminated. But cash is only one component of black wealth: about 1% of it. It has now been confirmed that 98.8% of demonetised currency has come back to the Reserve Bank of India. Further, of the ?16,000 crore that is still out, most of it is accounted for. In brief, not even 0.01% of black money has been extinguished. Black money is a result of black income generation. This is produced by various means which are not affected by the one-shot squeezing out of cash. Any black cash squeezed out by demonetisation would then quickly get regenerated. So, there is little impact of demonetisation on the black economy, on either wealth or incomes. The government is highly embarrassed, and to cover it up, it has again changed the goalpost. It now argues that it is good that black money has been deposited in the banks because those depositing it can now be caught. But the government had tried to prevent people from depositing demonetised currency by changing rules during the 50-day period. It is now fighting hard in the Supreme Court against giving one more chance to deposit the demonetised notes that may have been left with the old and the infirm. The government changed the goalpost earlier in November 2016 when it suggested that the real aim of demonetisation was a cashless society. Now it says that idle money has come into the system, the cash-to-GDP ratio will decline, the tax base will expand, and so on. But none of these required demonetisations and could and should have been implemented independently. Further, anticipating the failure of demonetisation in 2016 itself, the government started saying that demonetisation is only one of the many steps to tackle the black economy. The governments argument that cash coming back to the banks will enable it to catch the generators of black income, and there will be formalisation of the economy, does not hold. Much of the cash in the system is held by the tens of millions of businesses as working capital and by the more than 25 crore households that need it for their day-to-day transactions.",,,
187,,"Tax evaders managed to legalise their ill-gotten gains? At least this is what the numbers make us feel as 99.3 per cent of demonetised notes have returned into the system revealed the annual report of 2017-18 released by RBI on Wednesday.The numbers have come after almost two years since the demonetisation was announced on November 8, 2016. RBI in its annual report for 2017-18 said counting the demonetised notes is over. Of the Rs 15.41 lakh crore worth Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in circulation on November 8, 2016, when the demonetisation was announced, notes worth Rs 15.31 lakh core (99.3 per cent) have been returned. The humungous task of processing and verification of specified bank notes (SBNs) was achieved, it said. This meant just Rs 10,720 crore of the junked currency did not return to the banking system. Political parties were quick to corner the BJP-led Narendra Modi government that demonetised high-value currency notes to curb black money. The withdrawal of notes had sparked an acute shortage of cash in India and hit the economic growth. The bad hangover sustained for months as businesses were hit and lakhs of people lost jobs, while 104 people died standing in long queues struggling to get their old currency exchanged or deposited. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram slammed the government after the RBI report saying the Indian economy had suffered due to the note ban by way of job loss, closure of industries and the GDP growth. Indian economy lost 1.5 per cent of GDP in terms of growth. That alone was a loss of Rs 2.25 lakh crore a year. Over 100 lives were lost. 15 crore daily wage earners lost livelihood for several weeks. Thousands of SMEs were shut. Lakhs of jobs were destroyed, Chidambaram tweeted. In a series of tweets, the former finance minister also said RBI figure has suggested that the government had actually demonetised only Rs 13,000 crore and the country paid a huge price for it. But RBI has said Rs 10,720 crore of the junked currency didnt return to the banking system. Chidambaram said every rupee of the Rs 15.42 lakh crore, barring a small sum of Rs 13,000 crore, has come back to RBI. I suspect the bulk of the Rs 13,000 crore is currency in Nepal and Bhutan and some that was lost or destroyed. Remember who had said that Rs 3 lakh crore will not come back and that will be a gain for the government!, he said. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said her apprehensions about the impact of demonetisation on the Indian economy had been held true by RBI report. As soon as the draconian demonetisation was announced on November 8, 2016, I immediately sensed by intuition that this is a big anti-people measure. It will severely affect the common people of the country, especially, farmers, unorganised sector, small entrepreneurs and hard-working middle class. Today, RBI in its annual report has vindicated our apprehension, Banerjee wrote on her Facebook page. Quoting RBI report, the Trinamool Congress supremo said 99.3 per cent of the demonetised money has come back to the banking system. My first question now is  where has the black money gone? she remarked. Raising doubts about the entire demonetisation exercise, Mamata asked if it was a scheme hatched to allow some black money holders to quietly convert their black money into white. The Modi government had listed curbing black money as the primary intention of the move, along with making India a less cash-based economy. But the goal posts kept shifting in the weeks and months since with the government citing several reasons to demonetise high value notes such as to choke terror funding, bribery, increasing tax base and checking counterfeit notes. Interestingly, compared with the previous year, there was an increase of 35 per cent in counterfeit notes detected in the denomination of Rs 100, while there was a noticeable increase of 154.3 per cent in counterfeit notes detected in the denomination of Rs 50. In new series of banknotes in the denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 2000, counterfeit notes detected during 2017-18 were 9,892 and 17,929 against 199 and 638, respectively, during the previous year.",,,
188,,"On November 8, 2016, in the evening, the Prime Minister of the country Narendra Modi announced on the television that post mid-night all the currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 will become invalid. This single decision was taken to flush out 86 per cent of the currency of the worlds seventh largest economy. It was termed as demonetisation. In the past, the world over, there have been a few such attempts but not one was successful. No expert has ever proposed such a step. The economists by and large have never endorsed such a line of action. So what prompted the Government of the day to make such an announcement? Was it the decision of one individual or the collective wisdom of the Cabinet? Were the experts consulted at all and was their opinion given any heed while going ahead with demonetisation? Several thoughts came to ones mind on that day: was it a dictatorial decision? Was it a whimsical decision? Or was it sheer economic adventurism or political expediency which guided this decision? Read on to grasp the myth and the reality of demonetisation. We were told by the Government and the spokespersons of the ruling party that demonetisation was the single most important step to curb black money and digitise the Indian economy. The myth purported was that demonetisation would completely eliminate black money from the Indian economy. The reality is that as per the RBI report, 99.3 percent of the demonetised currency has crept back into the economy! Demonetisation was professed to be an attack on crony capitalists; in reality it broke the back of Indias teeming millions; the low and middle-income groups were worst affected. Black money recovered from the system after demonetisation was expected to be ploughed back into the economy as public investments in infrastructure and other public welfare projects; the reality is that demonetisation choked small and medium enterprises and brought millions of daily wage earners in the country on the brink of economic despair and starvation. Instead of being a well-thought out scheme with a clear implementation plan demonetisation resulted in serpentine queues of millions of under-privileged Indians for weeks on end resulting in what some authentic sources say the death of over a hundred people. A similar exercise in a Latin American country a few years ago had caused widespread riots and looting of banks; it goes to the credit of the common folk of this great country who bore the brunt of demonetisation with courage and fortitude. In retrospect, they were all misled by the myth that demonetisation was a fight against black money and corruption. On the second anniversary of the deed recently, the myth was shattered and the stark reality was evident to the people of this country. Demonetisation has proved to be a dictatorial and mindless act keeping short term political gains in mind. Those political gains were achieved in the State elections which followed in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. But, these short term gains will certainly be reversed in Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and the States which went to poll recently. Short term political expediency will give way to long term political loss. The myth is shattered. Remember, you can fool some people all the time, all people some of the time but not all the people all the time. The people of India will no longer be fooled and they will respond in a quiet and peaceful manner through the ballot box in 2019. Demonetisation was expected to benefit all; this was another myth. In reality, it benefitted one man, one party and the crony capitalists under their care; both politically and financially. The highest amount of cash exchange happened in the banks in a particular State where a particular person, chairperson of a particular political party was on the board of directors. In the name of digitisation of the economy one particular digital payment company benefited, their consumers and profits increased manifolds while the common man was majorly inconvenienced and the economy suffered. For small gains, the whole nation was put through tremendous hardships. The money spent on printing new currency and recalibrating the ATMs with the damaging effect of countless livelihoods was never considered as a cost by the Government at all. Small businesses were affected-many havent been able to recover even now, two years down the line. As the fiasco of demonetisation unfolded, the reasons for it as per the Government kept changing. From curbing black money, it changed into encouraging digital economy to starving the cash flow to terrorists and stone pelters to stopping counterfeit currency etc. The goal post kept changing almost every day. However, now we know for sure all these were myths peddled by the Government for most of the cash is back in the system, we are back to the same level of cash transactions, terrorists are as active as before and Rs 2000 note is easiest to counterfeit. Demonetisation helped the rich to convert their black money into accounted cash. Another benefit of demonetisation was supposed to be the increasing tax compliance. The numbers of returns filed have surely increased however the quantum of increase in the tax collection is not known as yet, whether it was worth the pain the people and the economy had to suffer. It was a misadventure, of a kind which should never happen with any country, its economy and its people. Perhaps, if RBI had taken a firm stand as it did recently with regards to access to its reserves, the nation would have been spared of much of misery. Thus, one wonders if demonetisation was a carefully thought out step to benefit the national economy and its people or was it a Tughlaqi idea to benefit a party and its short term agenda.",,,
189,,"The Reserve Bank of India released its annual report for 2017-18 on August 29, 2018. That 99.3% of the demonetised currency has come back to the banking system has been the most talked about part of the report, but this is not exactly new information. It was already known that most demonetised currency had come back to the banking system. The statistics worth looking at in this years report are those which give details about the denomination-wise break-up of the currency in circulation. These figures are better than last years figures because now the remonetisation process can be assumed to have been fully completed. Not much seems to have changed in terms of value. Slightly more than one-third of the total currency in circulation was in denominations greater than Rs 500 at the end of March 2018, which is nearly the same as the corresponding values in March 2015 and 2016, the last two years before demonetisation. However, things have changed drastically in terms of volume. The share of currency in denominations greater than Rs 500 has more than halved in March 2018, compared to what it was in March 2016. This is basically the result of ?2000 notes replacing Rs 1000 notes. In a perfect world, this should not matter. The supply of currency both in value and volume terms has increased compared to what it was before demonetisation. But this could have changed things in a big way in the conduct of day-to-day transactions. Heres why. A person conducting a retail cash transaction above Rs 500 in the pre-demonetisation period would have needed a lesser amount in change than she would in the post-demonetisation world. The reason being, she will now have to get a Rs 2000 note changed and not a Rs 1000 note which was the case earlier. Ceteris paribus this is bound to lead to an increase in transaction demand for notes with denominations up to Rs 500. Given the fact that the share of currency notes of denominations up to Rs 500 has not changed before and after demonetisation, there is a probability of increased cash crunch in day to day cash transactions. Should the RBI have altered the distribution of currency in circulation after demonetisation in favour of lower denomination notes? The 2017-18 Annual Reports statistics on indent (reacquisition) and supply of different denominations of currency notes supports this argument. Indeed, through 2017, and 2018, several news reports have said RBI is stepping up printing of smaller denomination currency notes. The shortfall in supply compared to indent of ?100 notes was more than 60% in 2017-18.",,,
190,,"On November 20, 2016, I was in a village in Hooghly district with other volunteers of our small non-governmental organization, waiting to interview applicants for one of our training programmes. We were in asamabay krishi unnayan samiti(a cooperative society set up, as the name suggests, for the benefit of farmers) at the invitation of thesamitismembers, who wanted us to conduct one of our courses there. Usually, these interviews are congenial, even jolly, affairs, with a lot of banter and crosstalk; occasionally, we would encounter someone who was clearly unfitted for our course (usually by virtue of belonging to a higher income group than our targeted beneficiaries) and sometimes there were far too many applicants than we could possibly accommodate; but this time there were just 28 applicants for 20-odd places in our course, so it should have been smooth sailing. Except that it wasnt. An air of gloom, even desperation, seemed to hang over the proceedings; applicant after applicant spoke of the dire uncertainty of their future, not just in economic terms but in ways that embraced pretty much all aspects of their lives  the impossibility of being certain if a daughter would be able to go to college, a nephew get married, a chronically ill parent receive treatment, a close relative get a loan to set up a small shop, and so on and on and on. Somewhat surprised to begin with, we were soon struck by the realization that it was less than a fortnight since the historic announcement of demonetization on November 8 2016, and just six days since the notification by the Reserve Bank of India that district central cooperative banks would no longer be allowed to accept deposits or exchange the now worthless 500- and 1,000-rupee notes. Virtually everyone we met that day had the bulk of her or his savings in cooperative societies which, in turn, did the bulk of their business with DCCBs. In the few days that DCCBs had accepted deposits and exchanged currency notes from SKUSs, transactions worth hundreds of crores had already taken place. Although people had had to stand in line for hours, most SKUSs had risen to the occasion and increased their work hours and the number of people at their counters. But now, it was all over. Not a single one of the people we met that day  the applicants for our course, family and friends who had accompanied them, members of the SKUS, other folk from the village  had any idea of how, if ever, this nightmare would end. This was the miasma of gloom and fear that hung over the meeting room that cool November afternoon 25 months ago. Things didnt really change much in the following weeks and months and a year later they were still limping along at best, assamitimembers kept telling us. It was not until next year, and after much litigation, that DCCBs were finally allowed to deposit the demonetized notes in their vaults with the RBI. These memories swum to the surface as I read Meera H. SanyalsThe Big Reverse: How Demonetization Knocked India Out an account of the devastating effects of demonetization on the times and lives of hundreds of millions of ordinary Indians. Sanyal is one of Indias most successful bankers, someone who has served in top positions in some of the worlds largest banks and financial institutions. She is no air-headed socialist; on the contrary, she champions markets, competition, and the need to encourage entrepreneurship, small-scale and large. Like most of us, she believes the stated aims of demonetization, as announced by the countrys prime minister on the night of November 8, 2016  eradicating black money, ending corruption and stopping terror-funding  are eminently laudable objectives that no patriotic Indian ought to argue with. To these three primary goals, she adds five others announced by the governments spokespersons in the days following demonetization: moving to a cashless society, expanding the tax base, integrating the informal sector of the economy with the formal, lowering interest rates and bringing down real estate prices. In the sixth chapter, Demonetization Report Card, she draws on government statistics to show how not a single one of these eight objectives came even close to being achieved. In her other five chapters, not including the Introduction and Conclusion, Sanyal looks at the effects of demonetization from the angle of people, institutions, economics and history. And what she says does not make for pretty reading. I am no economist or political scientist, but in over three decades of trying to understand literary texts, and by speaking with people from a wide range of backgrounds, I have understood two things: stories matter and memory is short. For most salaried city-dwellers like me, demonetization was a shock to the system, but a shock we recovered from fairly rapidly. In the days immediately after November 8, 2016 many (most?) neighbourhood shops openedkhatasfor their regular customers, where purchases were noted down and payment asked for only after the total had inched close to Rs 2,000; more establishments started accepting card payments; even queueing up outside banks and ATMs turned into something resembling a street-sideadda, and the frequent (and often contradictory) orders issued by the RBI provided much grist for the mills ofparahumorists. Yes, there was hardship, which we encountered not always first-hand but often from those who worked in our homes or ferried fresh provisions to our doorstep or ran a localchaishop; and many times we helped them out in small but not insignificant ways  by not asking for change, by taking their now-useless notes and giving them fresh legal tender in exchange, by making advances against a future months salary, and so forth. Things were far worse in non-urban areas. There is little data on how many people lost livelihoods in villages, how many patients went untreated, how much additional interest had to be given to usurious moneylenders to pay for daily necessities, how many social gatherings and family events had to be cancelled or drastically curtailed yet anyone who has even a nodding acquaintance with rural India will have heard many of these stories of loss and despair. On the 21st day of the second month in the third year after demonetization most of those who read this paper will have probably forgotten the hardships undergone by ordinary people, the chaos created in every sector of the economy, and the failures swept quietly under the carpet by the architects of demonetization. Through her meticulously documented, carefully crafted, deeply felt and, most of all, profoundly human book, Sanyal has given us reason to remember the many stories that went into the making of this strange and, ultimately, tragic chapter in our countrys recent history.",,,
191,,"Last week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)disclosedthat all but?10,720 crore of the?15.4 trillion of demonetized high-value currencies, is back in the banking system. In the process, RBI formally belied the governments much touted ex-ante claim that at least?3 trillion of this money, since it was stored as illegal cash, will be extinguished, serving up an unexpected fiscal bonanza. The political bloodletting that followed once again ensured that issues continue to be obfuscated and degenerate into a blame game targeting potential electoral gains. The actual outcome of this audacious move, for several reasons, is far more nuanced. For one,the expected economic gains from demonetisation, as most critics have rightly argued, was questionable, especially, the fundamental claim about a substantial chunk of high-value currency getting extinguished. This claim assumed that most of the black money, or illegal wealth, was being stashed away in cash. With the benefit of hindsight, this was obviously an erroneous assumption; needless to say, policy mandarins should have known better. Worse, even the cash holdings were easily laundered by exploiting various loopholes. This leads to the second point about how, after the initial shock, money was laundered through mulesexactly why we ended up with serpentine queuesand some complicit personnel, including in the banking system. Yes; the Union government got egg on its face, as it was unable to contain laundering. True, but it is a resounding wake-up call about a broken system. It has long been suspected that the delivery system in India, especially of public goods, has been thoroughly corrupt and rendered inefficientexactly why the parallel economy financed by black money has taken root. The hollowing out of institutions, key to the sound functioning of a democracy, has only exacerbated this problem. Third, flowing from the above, is the underlying politics of demonetisation. Unveiling the move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had emphasized the importance of demonetisation of high-value currencies in targeting black money. Since illegal wealth is stored by the corrupt, the general populace read this as the singular message of demonetisationsomething that contributed to the record victory the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) achieved in the Uttar Pradesh election soon after. The sense was, like this column has said in the past, that the premium on honesty was being restored. Indeed, the move was ham-handed and riddled with avoidable administrative glitches. But the scale and audacity of the move sent out a strong signal that the government was determined to pursue the rule of law. The introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) last year has only spurred India to move even further away from the discretion-based approach. Fourthly, it is more than just coincidence that there has been a marked broadening of Indias direct tax base. Information sharing among various tax arms of the government has grown dramatically over the last decade and more. The introduction of GST has only underlined the audit trails in economic transactions, making it that much more difficult to conceal money. Finance minister Arun Jaitley had disclosed last week, in a social media post, thatthe number of income tax returnsalmost doubled from 38 million in 2013-14 to 68.6 million in fiscal 2017-18. While it was never the Plan A of the demonetisation strategy, the growth in digital money has got a big leg-up. With e-commerce poised to accelerate, there is every reason to believe that this will only gather further momentum. Exactly why foreign investors,including Warren Buffet, are lining up for a slice of the action. Finally, the biggest let-down has been that politics of confrontation has denied the country a fair debate on demonetisation. Disruption in Parliament ensured that we never really heard from the finance minister on the logic of the move, the extent of black money and so on. Neither did we get to hear the critics. (In contrast, in 1991, when then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao unleashed an unprecedented acceleration in reforms, Parliament witnessed a revealing debate.)",,,
192,,"Twenty-one years ago, on January 27, 1996, a raid on the offices of the Animal Husbandry department in Chaibasa unearthed the Rs 950-crore fodder scam that embroiled then Bihar chief minister Lalu Yadav in a lifelong tussle with the CBI. Large-scale embezzlement of government treasury funds given to non-existent companies for purchase and supply of cattle fodder in Bihar in the 1990s was the highlight of this scam. The fodder scam started with small-scale embezzlement done by low level government employees to show transfer of some fake funds. When it grew, it also started to include businesses and politicians, increasing the amount of money embezzled. The then Comptroller and Auditor General of India, TN Chaturvedi, noticed delays in submissions of monthly accounts of the Bihar treasury and warned of possible laundering of funds in 1985. The Animal Husbandry department had made fraudulent withdrawals of big bills of Rs 1,000 crore in the name of medicines during the chief ministerial tenure of Lalu Yadav. However, the raid only happened in 1996. In March of the same year, the Patna High Court directed CBI to investigate the scam. As the investigation progressed, the CBI formally requested the then Governor of Bihar for permission to prosecute the CM. In June 1997, the CBI filed chargesheets against Lalu Yadav and 55 other co-accused. The accused had 63 cases registered against them under three sections:IPC Sections 420 (forgery) and 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy) and Section 13 (b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Lalu Yadav resigned as chief minister as his then partyJanata Dalpressured him to not hold office while being under criminal prosecution. He dissociated from Janata Dal and formed his own partyRashtriya Janata Dal. He resigned in July due to mounting pressure but installed his wife Rabri Devi as the chief minister who won  the vote of confidence in July 1997.A case of Disproportionate Assets was registered against him in 1998, with Rabri Devi being named as a co-accused for abetting the crime. The Income Tax department had said that Lalu had gathered Rs 46 lakh from the government treasury. The duo surrendered to a CBI court in 2000. However, Rabri was able to get bail while Lalu Yadav stayed in jail. A month later, Patna Hight Court granted him bail which was extended several times. By this time, the new state of Jharkhand had been formed and the fodder scam cases were transferred to Ranchi. Aspecial CBI court in Ranchi acquitted both Lalu and his wife on December 18, 2006 in the DA case. In 2012, nine years after the chargesheet against 44 people was filed in a cased related to the multi-crore fodder scam, the CBI framed charges against Lalu Yadav and others. They were all convicted by a Patna CBI court in 2013, a judgment that Lalu Yadav contested.The conviction alsodisqualified and barred him from contesting any election for 11 years. In 2014, Lalu moved the Jharkhand HC challenging the verdict of the CBI court. The Supreme Court in May ordered a trial against Lalu Prasad, and directed that it be complete within 9 months, after it allowed a CBI plea which opposed the dropping of charges against the former chief minister.",,,
193,,"By setting aside the Jharkhand High Court's verdict, the Supreme Court on Monday paved the way for a fresh trial of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad, former Bihar Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra, and other accused in a criminal case involving the withdrawal of money and falsification of records from the Deoghar Treasury in connection with the ?900-crore fodder scam. Two decades have passed since the scam was unearthed. It involved politicians and bureaucrats belonging to successive administrations siphoning off several crores of rupees, on the pretext of purchasing livestock feed, over a period of 20 years. It was one of the early cases where sitting legislators were convicted and had to lose their Assembly and parliamentary seats. It is also the reason why a popular leader such as Mr. Prasad is not contesting elections, even though he played a key role in the RJD-JD(U) combine wresting power in Bihar. The fodder scam is a collective term for a set of 64 cases, of which 53 were litigated in Ranchi. It all began in 1985 when then CAG T.N. Chaturvedi sniffed out a possible embezzlement of funds from the Bihar Treasury and various departments. The CAG noticed delay in monthly account submissions from the State and also noted small scale false expense reports. Ten years later, the 'small scale' embezzlements added up to Rs. 900 crores. In 1996, State Finance Secretary V.S. Dubey ordered district magistrates and deputy commissioners of all districts to go into cases of excessive withdrawals. Around the same time, then Deputy Commissioner Amit Khare raided the office of the Animal Husbandry Department at Chaibasa. It unearthed a huge cache of documents showing illegal withdrawals and revealed a nexus between officials and suppliers. The State government instituted two separates one-man commissions of inquiry. The first was headed by State Development Commissioner Phoolchand Singh and was constituted on January 30, 1996. However, this one was aborted when Mr. Singh's name began to figure in the charge sheet. The second commission was headed by Justice Sarwar Ali and was instituted on March 10, 1996. Meanwhile, the Patna High Court ordered the CBI to take over the probe after a public interest litigation was filed by State BJP president Sushil Kumar Modi. Both Mr. Mishra and Mr. Prasad were named in the CBI's charge sheet in July 1997. Succumbing to pressure, Mr. Prasad gave up the Chief Minister post, but not before installing his wife Rabri Devi in the post. The Jharkhand High Court continued hearing the cases after Bihar was bifurcated. The fodder scam didn't help the Opposition much as Mr. Prasad, and the RJD emerged triumphant in the 2000 elections. Ms. Rabri Devi survived a vote of confidence and became the Chief Minister with the support of the Congress and the JMM. Mr. Prasad contested in the Rajya Sabha election and later in the general elections. He even served as Railway Minister between 2004 and 2009, when the trials were under way. The BJP and the JD(U) effectively turned the scam into a poll plank, which led the alliance to power in 2005. The combine governed the State until they broke it in 2014. In 2013, Mr. Prasad and Mr. Mishra were convicted in the Chaibasa Treasury case, the first among the 53 cases. Both the leaders are out on bail and have appealed against their conviction. ",,,
194,,"In a setback to Lalu Prasad Yadav, the Supreme Court today ruled that the RJD leader will stand trial separately in all four fodder scam cases as it set aside the Jharkhand high court order which had dropped conspiracy charges against him. A bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra and Amitava Roy directed the trial court to complete the proceedings against 68-year-old Yadav and others within nine months. We have held that for each offence there will be a separate trial, the bench said. The fodder scam relates to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 900 crore by the Animal Husbandry Department from various district when Lalu was the chief minister. Former Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra and former state chief secretary Sajal Chakraborty are also accused in the case. The apex court, while setting aside the 2014 high court order which had stayed the trial against Yadav after conviction in one of the cases, said the high court should have been consistent in its findings and not have given different views for different sets of accused in a case. It also pulled up the CBI for delay in filing the appeal against the high court order in the case and said the probe agencys director should have looked into this important matter and deputed an officer to pursue the case. The CBI had challenged the 2014 order of the Jharkhand high court quashing four pending fodder scam cases against him on the grounds that a person convicted in one case could not be tried in similar cases based on same witnesses and evidences. The apex court had in November 2016 pulled up Mishra for allegedly dragging and delaying the appeal filed by CBI challenging the quashing of four pending fodder scam cases against him. The high court had on November 14, 2014 upheld the CBI plea to continue proceedings in the trial court against Yadav under two sections while dropping other charges on the grounds that a person cannot be tried twice for the same offence. The charges are in connection with fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 96 lakh during the chief ministerial tenure of the RJD chief.",,,
195,,"Despite the use of the term ""surgical strikes"", the Indians definitely did not airdrop commandos to hit ""launching pads of militants"" inside Pakistani-held territory, or conduct ground assaults deep into the Pakistan-administered side. But they did cross the Line of Control (LoC), in some cases by more than a kilometre, to hit nearby Pakistani border posts. Police officials on the Pakistani side privately concede that such a ground assault did occur in the Madarpur-Titrinot region of Poonch sector, west of Srinagar, where a Pakistani post was destroyed, and one soldier killed. In Leepa valley to the north, locals said that the Indians crossed the LoC and set up their guns on ridges directly overlooking the village of Mundakali. A Pakistani border post located at some distance east of the village was hit. Two other posts higher up in the mountains were also hit. At least four Pakistani soldiers were injured in the attack, which lasted from 05:00am until 8:00am, locals said. A similar advance by the Indians in the Dudhnial area of Neelum valley further north was beaten back by the Pakistanis. At least one Pakistani soldier was injured - reports of a dead soldier could not be independently verified by the BBC. The Pakistani army described the exchanges as nothing more than cross-border firing, albeit in a more co-ordinated fashion and all along the LoC. Officials said two soldiers were killed in the attacks - one in Poonch, and one in Bhimber sector, further south. Defence minister Khwaja Asif later said a total of nine soldiers were injured in the assault. Indian troops could not have hit a target and returned alive as the climb required was too steep, officials said. Nor could helicopters have been used to drop special forces given the difficult terrain and because Pakistan would have shot down the aircraft. There is no conclusive evidence to prove either side's claims - the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.",,,
196,,"Prime ministerNarendra Modiis akin to a phenomenon rarely seen in Indian or global politics. He remains extremely popular among the citizens despite efforts by many in the media and opposition to continually criticise and pull him down. When the NDA won the election in 2014 and Modi became the prime minister in the first term, he probably already had a clear strategy to uplift India into a vibrant country that met the needs of all the citizens. In his very first address, he swung into motion a grand Swacch Bharat mission: that every household must have a toilet, that open defecation becomes a thing of the past, and that dignity is brought back into the heart of the Indian citizen, particularly the woman. What India hadnt achieved in 67 years of Independence was achieved in PM Modis first five-year termIndia is now nearly 100% open defecation free (ODF) compared to 38.7% in October 2014.

He then turned his attention to financial and digital inclusion. Recognising that, in this new age of knowledge-economy-led growth, individual and national development are intimately connected to a citizens ability to access digital and banking platforms, he launched Digital India and drove the next wave of growth via the India Stack, where every Indian would have access to personal identification (Aadhaar), internet and mobile connectivity, and bank account (Jan Dhan). To date, 90% of Indians have Aadhaar, and Jan Dhan has provided more than 40 crore with a bank account digitally accessible via their mobilea significant majority for the first time.

India Stack has also unlocked productivity leaps in subsidy and relief delivery via the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system; Rs 12 lakh crore has been disbursed via DBT resulting in a savings of Rs 1.7 lakh crore. Forty-two crore beneficiaries received relief and minimum income support during the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. Indias digital inclusion drive has been a massive success, by domestic and global standards.

The distribution of gas stoves and connections has made a phenomenal difference to rural family health, particularly the women. Before the Ujjwala Yojana gas cylinder distribution, smoke and ensuing lung problems were commonplace. With smoke-free cooking enabled by gas stoves, this has ceased to be a problem. The number of gas connections increased from 12 crore in 2014 to 25 crore.

PM Modi then turned his attention towards industry reforms with demonetisation, GST, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). These were undertaken to reform corporate India and rid the country of crony capitalism. These reforms have drawn criticism from many, perhaps forgetting that demonetisation has broken the back of the black money class. The use of black money has reduced considerably. Long-term habits to deal in black money have been mostly converted into the default use of digital banking systems.

GST has been an outstanding success towards Indias move to reduce supply chain costs, which today account for 14% of GDP as against 6% in China and 5% in the US. Seventeen taxes were rolled into one, providing a uniform system for the first time in 70 years, and effective indirect taxes have reduced. In its first month, the system onboarded 56 lakh filers. For various reasons, GST has not shown buoyancy, but one can expect to see the effect in the future.

Infrastructure development has been another significant push of the Modi government. Rural road connectivity, railways development, and construction of high-speed roads, ports and airports have taken off at a fast paceall vital ingredients to increase Indias productivity and reduce supply chain costs.

Make-in-India, at commencement, was not a great success because it was cast in the traditional mould without a focus on the policy changes and incentives required. Subsequently, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for large scale electronics proved successfulmobile manufacturing has risen multifold, making India an exporter. Merging PLI-like strategies with the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan push could make Make-in-India a success.

PM Modis next focus was health. Ayushman Bharat was launched to provide health insurance cover to the millions of uninsured in India; 12.6 crore e-cards have been issued, and 1.2 crore hospital admissions were managed through this scheme. The next frontier in health is the Bharat Health Stack, built on the India Stack architecture, which will further improve access and management of healthcare in India.

Other reforms that have the potential for sizeable economic impact have been in simplifying labour laws, incentivising and reclassifying MSMEs, especially with the guaranteed loan programmes, reduction in corporate tax rates, and deregulating the farm sector, which will empower farmers to double their income by 2022.

The emphasis on employment needs better policies and focus, but it will certainly improve when the effects from these other reforms bear fruit.

During the Covid-19 pandemic and national lockdowns, PM Modis focus was on ensuring the lives and livelihoods of the bottom-of-the-pyramid. All the reforms and digital advancements made earlier are proving extremely useful in these difficult times. Rations and minimum income support were extended to 80 crore Indians, which wouldnt have been possible without Digital India and India Stack. PM Modis housing programme has also been an outstanding success in bringing dignity to crores of Indians with pucca housing; 1.1 crore houses have been built, targeting a total of 2.95 crores by 2022. The return of migrants during the Covid-lockdown has accelerated this programme and enabled them to build a life in their hometowns. With this acceleration, the timeline to build a house has reduced from 120 days to a 45-60 day horizon.

At this rate, by 2022, all Indians will have access to basic necessitieshousing, clean water, gas connections, bank accounts, internet and mobile connectivity, road access, and educationespecially with the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020. For a population of 138 crore, these are remarkable achievements. PM Modi had a clear strategy to reach this point, unambiguous aspirations and a structured sequence of reforms and policies.

Previous political regimes launched schemes like Garibi Hatao, which were unsuccessful because they focused more on politics and less on execution. PM Modi has inverted this paradigm, and personally monitors and reviews progress on the programmes. He leverages technology platforms wherever possible to ensure the programmes are executed as soon as possible. He sets clear priorities for himself and his government. He has not fallen victim to unnecessary politics. His foreign policy moves have made the Middle East friends of India, and the entire world looks more favourably on the country now. Standing up to hegemonic China, too, has improved our standing in the world.

No prime minister has done as much for Indias development as PM Modi has in his six years. As India celebrates PM Modis birthday, citizens all over the country pay tribute to this remarkable leader.",,,
197,,"It is a fact, not just an opinion, that Prime MinisterNarendra Modistraddles Indias political firmament like a colossus. This is acknowledged by all, friend and foe, expert or novice. As he begins his 20th year in public life  he took oath as Gujarats chief minister for the first time this week 19 years ago  his ascendance and dominance is worth understanding better. In 1987, when he joined the BJP, he had already made a name for himself as a tireless worker, quick on the uptake, making valuable contributions, and as a charismatic and strategic thinker. Nevertheless, as is all too well known, his debut as Gujarats chief minister was to quickly become a trial by fire, the kind few leaders survive.
No politician in independent India has been demonised in such a relentless, Goebbelsian manner as him, and none has withstood it all with such resilience and courage. Despite years of concerted attacks on him by the then-dominant mainstream media, his popularity only grew, his grip on both politics and governance only got firmer. That ability to go beyond the circumstances in which he found himself has been a crucially important trait since his youth. From going past traditional familial constraints to wandering, exploring, seeking, and discovering his purpose, his is a classic journey that many young idealists fantasise about, but rarely dare to attempt. The fact that his detractors tried to persistently target him, despite him prevailing in trials in courts and in public opinion, was resented by his support base. That not only helped consolidate his hold over them in the state, but also started the bandwagon of similar support nationwide.

A lesser man might have been content with that, perhaps even planned an extension of his entrenchment as Gujarats undisputed leader. Instead, Modi decided to, and succeeded in, transforming his image into that of Mr Development. It did not happen overnight, and it did not happen easily. He had to work against the tide of initial opposition from many quarters, not least of all significant leaders of industry and their associations. Slowly, but surely, he built a track record of decisiveness, of laying out the red carpet for investment, of out-of-the-box solutions for age-old bottlenecks like inconsistent power supply, and all that while avoiding the taint of corruption. Even as a CM he started acquiring a global reputation as a can-do leader.

That is not to say he gave up being the champion of the broadest section of the electorate, nor on his passion for a resurgent, modern India that also took pride in its ancient heritage. He has all along spoken out against the hypocrisy of those who represented what passed for secularism and liberalism in India, but made a mockery of that with their policies of appeasement, pandering to the fears and schisms in sections of society instead of trying to unite them. It is surely one of the great ironies of modern times that the person who marshalled the political will to bring about Triple Talaq reform in India was not from among those secularists and liberals, but one who has been unceasingly vilified by them.

The fact is, this prime minister has been just as staunch a reformer on a wide range issues, taking on established shibboleths. These include not just social changes, but also stunning advances on political and economic reforms that had long been given lip service by all but had also acquired the aura of being unachievable. The latest of these is the recent farm bills that have been advocated by virtually everyone, except perhaps far-left ideologues, for decades. Looking back to the national political scenario a dozen years ago, it was obvious to many that Modi would almost inevitably lead the nation sooner or later. Even as the government of the day got ever more deeply mired in corruption scandals, infighting and palace intrigues, it continued to be blithely oblivious to the mood of the people. When the then prime minister, a member of a minority community himself, spoke of minorities having the first right on the nations resources, a tipping point was reached.

In the other corner stood a long-standing chief minister, exuding charisma, personal honesty, transparency, and good governance. But also unafraid to speak bluntly, against nepotism in politics, against cosseting sections of the population in ghettos, both physical and legislative, and was confidently asserting nationalism and an Indian renaissance. Born of this confluence of circumstances and preparation were such slogans as sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas, and minimum government, maximum governance.

It is worth remembering that the long-entrenched elites he dislodged pushed back with a vehemence born from seeing their world evaporating before their eyes. They united to deny him early attempts at reform, such as on land acquisition, and, emboldened, thereafter opposed him tooth and nail on virtually every decision. They mocked those slogans and dubbed him a non-reformer.

And yet, reform he did, against all odds. The GST is arguably the single-biggest economic reform since Independence. And despite the persistent badmouthing of demonetisation by opponents, it triggered the transition to digitisation that made possible the large-scale monetary aid to hundreds of millions of Indians during this pandemic. The reset that he did with Indias response to cross-border terror attacks must also rank as immensely significant. In this time he has emerged as one of the most influential global leaders.

The second term has begun with a breathtaking shifting of gears, pushing through many long-pending, big-ticket reforms. And yet, while his opponents continue as if in a time warp, doubling down on their failed tactics, Narendra Modi keeps evolving, his best yet to come.",,,
198,,"The Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday decided to reach out to Delhiites for their opinion on whether the nascent party should form a minority government with Congress support. The feedback in the form of individual letters, centralised SMSs, on social networking sites such as partys official facebook page and its website will be gathered till Sunday before deciding on government formation on Monday.

Stung by criticism that it is running away from forming a government despite Congress support, AAP announced that it would be sending out 25 lakh letters inviting peoples views. Similarly, a centralised mobile number will receive peoples single-word opinion (yes or no) through SMS.

Kejriwal on Saturday wrote to Congress and BJP asking their views on 18 issues after the lieutenant governor invited AAP to form a government. The BJP-Akali Dal (32 seats) had declined to form the government. AAP (28 seats) was the second-largest while Congress won just eight seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly. While the BJP refused to reply, the Congress reply on Monday stated that 16 issues were administrative affairs and it was with AAP on the remaining two. The partys political affairs committee discussed Congress reply, followed by a meeting of its candidates before Kejriwal went public. The meeting with candidates threw up a mixed response. Post-December 8 when result was announced, most had said they favoured re-election. But on Tuesday many said they felt that the response from ground  especially after Kejriwals letter  favoured AAP to form the government.

The candidates were asked to gather public feedback. After all, it is not a question of personal opinion. Important is to find out what people want, said a party leader.",,,
199,,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has decided to seek the opinion of the people on whether they should form a government in Delhi with the support of the Congress party. At the same time, the party pooh-poohed the extension of support by the Congress party, describing it as shatir (clever). AAP had decided to seek the peoples opinion as there was a strong view within the party that it should form a government with outside support of the Congress even for six months to fulfil its agenda and also to show that it can deliver, AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal said at a press conference here on Tuesday.
According to Mr. Kejriwal, there is another view in the party that the Congress will not withdraw its support till the Lok Sabha elections.
Accepting the diversity of views within the party, Mr. Kejriwal said that while a few members of the Political Affairs Committee and MLAs supported the idea of forming the government some others wanted the party to go for re-election. This morning we had our meeting of PAC and MLAs. Unlike the other parties, we do not take decisions in closed rooms, therefore the party decided to take peoples opinion, he said.



The party has chalked a six-day programme during which it will organise 270 public rallies in each municipal ward to take a sense of peoples opinion. Over 25 lakh copies of Mr. Kejriwals letter addressed to the people of Delhi will also be distributed during the opinion gathering campaign. People can send their feedback to the party through SMS, phone calls and social media. The party will complete the process by Sunday and is likely to meet the Lieutenant-Governor on Monday.",,,
200,,"A day after it sought a referendum on forming a government in Delhi with outside support of the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party received over 4.20 lakh responses through various channels. It is yet to analyse the data to ascertain their nature. We had sought feedback from the people of Delhi regarding their views on formation of a government. And within 24 hours, we have received over 4.2 lakh responses through different channels, including the Interactive Voice Response system, short-message service, our website and the partys Facebook page, an AAP spokesperson told The Hindu. The maximum number of responses were received through SMSes. The party has got 25 lakh pamphlets printed to reach out to the people. Our next course of action would be a door-to-door survey. The exercise will commence on Thursday. Public meetings attended by senior leaders will also be organised in all municipal wards. The data collected will be analysed and the results are expected to be out in the public domain next Monday, the spokesperson added.
The AAP decided to go for the referendum as the deadlock over formation of the government has persisted since the BJP, the single largest party with 31 out of the 70 Assembly seats, refused to take the plunge. The AAP, with 28 seats, which was also invited by the Lieutenant-Governor for a discussion on the issue, has sought time to arrive at a decision. Describing the Congress as shatir (clever), Mr. Kejriwal said the AAPs decision to go to the people followed a strong view within the party that they should form the government with Congress support, even if it is for six months, to fulfil its agenda and prove that it could deliver on its promises. It is learnt that some sections of the party also felt that it was trying to escape from its responsibility to govern.",,,
201,,"The NITI Aayog was formed to bring fresh ideas to the government. Its first mandate is to act as a think tank. It can be visualised as a funnel through which new and innovative ideas come from all possible sources  industry, academia, civil society or foreign specialists  and flow into the government system for implementation. We have regular brainstorming sessions with stakeholders from various industries and sectors. Initiatives like Ayushmaan Bharat, our approach towards artificial intelligence and water conservation measures, and the draft bill to establish the National Medical Commission to replace the Medical Council of India have all been conceptualised in NITI Aayog, and are being taken forward by the respective Ministries. In that sense, I think of NITI Aayog as an action tank rather than just a think tank. By collecting fresh ideas and sharing them with the Central and State governments, it pushes frontiers and ensures that there is no inertia, which is quite natural in any organisation or institution. If it succeeds, NITI Aayog could emerge as an agent of change over time and contribute to the Prime Ministers agenda of improving governance and implementing innovative measures for better delivery of public services.

We also work to cut across the silos within the government. For example, India still has the largest number of malnourished children in the world. We want to reduce this number vastly, but this requires a huge degree of convergence across a number of Ministries, and between Central and State governments. NITI Aayog is best placed to achieve this convergence and push the agenda forward.

NITI Aayog is also bringing about a greater level of accountability in the system. Earlier, we had 12 Five-Year Plans, but they were mostly evaluated long after the plan period had ended. Hence, there was no real accountability.

NITI Aayog has established a Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office which collects data on the performance of various Ministries on a real-time basis. The data are then used at the highest policymaking levels to establish accountability and improve performance. This performance- and outcome-based real-time monitoring and evaluation of government work can have a significant impact on improving the efficiency of governance.

Using such data, we also come up with performance-based rankings of States across various verticals to foster a spirit of competitive federalism. That is another big mandate of NITI Aayog. We identify the best practices in different States in various sectors and then try to replicate them in other States. We also play an important role of being the States representative in Delhi, and facilitate direct interactions with the line ministries, which can address issues in a relatively shorter time. The Atal Innovation Mission, which is also established under NITI Aayog, has already done commendable work in improving the innovation ecosystem in India. It has established more than 1,500 Atal Tinkering Labs in schools across the country and this number is expected to go up to 5,000 by March 2019. It has also set up 20 Atal Incubation Centres for encouraging young innovators and start-ups.

With its current mandate that is spread across a range of sectors and activities, and with its unique and vibrant work culture, NITI Aayog remains an integral and relevant component of the governments plans to put in place an efficient, transparent, innovative and accountable governance system in the country.

202,,"The erstwhile Planning Commission had been on the decline since 1991, much before the final blow was delivered to it by the present regime in 2014. At some point, the charge of the Planning Commission was entrusted to eminent experts, many of whom had trained in neoliberal schools. This did not fit well with the imperative for an inclusive and equitable path of economic development in India, which is a socially hierarchical and economically iniquitous society.",,,
203,,"In the original Nehruvian vision, the public sector was entrusted with the economy, given the weak market mechanism which was dominated by mercantile capital and a feudalistic system, especially in rural areas. Even then, the Planning Commission controlled only half of the total investment in India, since what was consciously adopted was a mixed economy system. It also fitted well with our republican democratic Constitution. The rise of neoliberalism, the decline of erstwhile socialist regimes worldwide, and the rise of right-wing market fundamentalists within the country paved the way for the demise of the Planning Commission. Its replacement by NITI Aayog looks more apologetic than substantial for the task of transforming a deeply unequal society into a modern economy that ensures the welfare of all its citizens, irrespective of their social identity.

It has no role in influencing, let alone directing, public or private investment. It does not seem to have any influence in policymaking with long-term consequences (for instance, demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax). NITI Aayog is supposed to be a think tank. This implies that while generating new ideas, it maintains a respectable intellectual distance from the government of the day. Instead, what we see is uncritical praise of government-sponsored, acronym-infested schemes. It sings paeans to the virtues of the private corporate sector as the saviour of the Indian economy without realising, let alone appreciating, the foundational and socially oriented contribution of Indias vast public sector.

How can a country like India transform itself with new ideas and strategies if it doesnt have a paradigm of planning for development? How can it lift its poor? How can we ensure that every working member of the Indian population has a decent job with at least a minimum wage and social/employment security? Why doesnt it occur to the political leadership to ask why more than 90% of those in the workforce slog in the unorganised sector  in small farms and tiny non-farm establishments  with two-thirds of the total being working poor? Why dont they ask why more than half the workers in the organised sector end up as insecure or informal labour? Why is the labour force participation rate of women so low and declining when neighbours like Bangladesh have registered an increasing trend? Why do the Dalits and Adivasis continue to be at the bottom of the ladder in every conceivable social and economic indicator of well-being? Why do regional, gender and other inequalities based on social identity keep increasing?

India requires planning that addresses social justice, reduces regional and gender inequalities, and ensures environmental sustainability.",,,
204,,"In line with the Government of Indias approach of less government and a move away from centralised planning, the NITI Aayog with a new structure and focus on policy will>replace the 64-year old Planning Commissionthat was seen as a vestige of the socialist era. The new body, conceived more in the nature of a think-tank that will provide strategic and technical advice, will be helmed by the Prime Minister with a Governing Council of Chief Ministers and Lt. Governors, similar to the National Development Council that set the objectives for the Planning Commission. The NITI Aayog seeks substitute centralised planning with a bottom-up approach where the body will support formulation of plans at the village level and aggregate them at higher levels of government. In short, the new body is envisaged to follow the norm of cooperative federalism, giving room to States to tailor schemes to suit their unique needs rather than be dictated to by the Centre. This is meant to be a recognition of the countrys diversity. The needs of a State such as Kerala with its highly developed social indicators may not be the same as that of, say, Jharkhand, which scores relatively low on this count. If indeed the body does function as has been envisaged now  and the jury will be out on that  States will, for the first time, have a say in setting their own development priorities. One significant change of note is that one of the functions of the body will be to address the needs of national security in economic strategy. Nowhere is this more relevant than in the area of energy security where India, unlike China, has failed to evolve a coherent policy over the years. Similarly, networking with other national and international think-tanks and with experts and practitioners, as has been envisaged, will add heft to the advice that the NITI Aayog will provide. To deflect criticism that this will be a free-market institution that ignores the deprived, the government has taken care to make the point that the body will pay special attention to the sections of society that may not benefit enough from economic progress. How this operates in practice will bear close watching. Interestingly, though it will not be formulating Central plans any more, the NITI Aayog will be vested with the responsibility of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of programmes. Thus, while the advisory and monitoring functions of the erstwhile Planning Commission have been retained in the new body, the executive function of framing Plans and allocating funds for Plan-assisted schemes has been taken away. But who will now be responsible for the critical function of allocating Plan funds? Hopefully, there will be greater clarity on this aspect in the days ahead.",,,
205,,"The first meeting of NITI Aayogs Governing Council was held in February 2015. Thereafter, three Sub-Groups of Chief Ministers were constituted by the Prime Minister, one each on rationalization of centrally sponsored schemes, skill development, and Swacch Bharat, with NITI Aayog acting as the secretariat. During its first three months, it initiated the work relating to the Mid-Term Appraisal of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. All the three Sub-Groups of Chief Ministers submitted their reports during the year 201516. In the finalization of these reports, the officials of NITI Aayog seemed to have played their role more as agents of the Central Government than as technical advisers. This was evident from the fact that just a day after the presentation of the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, the Ministry of Finance issued a notification without taking on board most of its recommendations. The fate of the reports by the other two Sub-Groups seems to have been similar.
In the second year of its operation, a second meeting of the Governing Council was held, which emphasized the shift in focus from planning to policy to influence the decisions of the private as well as the public sectors. The conference also emphasized the need for greater interaction between the Centre and the States. In this context, it was suggested that NITI Aayog should act as a repository of best practices for States and provide them advocacy support in resolving matters pending with the Union Ministries.

The Aayog took up the pending cases of the State of Telangana with the Union Ministries concerned while requesting other States to make use of its intermediation. But in retrospect, this role was more recommendatory and most of its suggestions were not acted upon by the Union Ministries concerned.

The Aayog also held a conference in July 2017 with the States to discuss their role in transforming India. However, the actions taken on the suggestions made by the States are still not known.

It also published a number of papers on sectors like agriculture, health, education, skill development, managing urbanization, power, infrastructure, social justice, etc. In the area of policy advocacy, it prepared a draft bill on agricultural land leasing and one on regulatory reforms, and completed the appraisal of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan suggesting policy correction in a number of areas. Most of these areas are in the domain of States. During the year 201617, the Aayog included, under the label of notable initiatives, the constitution of a Committee of Chief Ministers on Digital Payments and initiated the process to develop identified islands for maritime trade, shipping, and fisheries, all areas identified as priority by Central Government.

The Aayog prepared the first-ever indices measuring States performance in health, education, and water management. It also discussed issues relating to the removal of distinction between Plan and non-Plan expenditure, and the attainment of targets set under Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with State officials. Further, it took up the formulation of a Fifteen-Year Vision document as well as a Seven-Year Strategy and a Three-Year Action Agenda to ensure implementation of the Vision. Of these, the Three-Year Action Agenda has already been released and placed in the public domain. There is no evidence that the States have participated in the preparation of this Vision.

The Aayogs Annual Report gives a detailed account of its work during the year 201718. Of relevance to UnionState relations is the draft roadmap for the development of the Northeastern and Eastern States, which is laudable. There is a separate section devoted to cooperative federalism. The report highlights two key aspects, and these relate to the joint development of the national developmental agenda by the Centre and the States, and the advocacy of State perspectives with Central Ministries. It also lists a series of initiatives to ensure that States are equal partners in the policy-making and implementing process. Among the items listed are the third meeting of the Governing Council, the National Conference of Chief Secretaries on drivers for transforming India, and several initiatives relating to agriculture.",,,
206,,"The major complaints of States in regard to the functioning of the Planning Commission remain unaddressed. The complaints have largely been on the perception that the Centre is encroaching upon the States responsibilities; imposing its own priorities while funding; assuming, without basis, that governance in States is weak despite the Unions own dismal record in administering Union Territories; taking credit for schemes that are jointly funded; and continuing to advocate a one-size-fits-all approach in administration. The Aayog has missed some opportunities to make a qualitative difference. The CSS had to be reformed in the light of the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission.

Though the Niti Aayog was involved in the process, the manner in which these schemes were modified shows that the effort was only to shift greater responsibility onto States in terms of financing. The reform does not in any manner reflect the qualitative change in the design and implementation of the Central schemes that was promised when the Planning Commission was wound up.

A second opportunity arose when the distinction between Plan and non-Plan was removed. At that point, the organization had an opportunity to insist on taking a sector-wise comprehensive view of capital and revenue expenditures. However, that has not been done.",,,
207,,"The easy stuff has been done. The Narendra Modi government has put out a press release to announce the formation of a Niti Aayog to replace the old Planning Commission. The signage outside Yojana Bhavan in New Delhi has changed. The website of the Planning Commission has been archived.

And now comes the hard part: what should the new institution do and how should it operate?

The Planning Commission was set up in 1950 when India had just become an independent republic. The threat of political fragmentation had not completely gone away; it was a mere three years after the bloody partition of the country. Central planning was as much a political project as it was an economic one. The early plans were drawn out when India was short of domestic savings and foreign exchange. The so-called two-gap models"" were common in the development economics of the time. The state was supposed to play the role of entrepreneur because it was assumed that private industry did not have the resources for large projects. Financial markets were shallow. The original focus of the Planning Commission was on resource allocation. It is no secret that the planning experiment was a failure after the first decade or so.

The India for which the Niti Aayog has been set up is a radically different country. The old assumptions about low domestic savings, foreign exchange constraints and shallow financial markets have withered away. The private sector has replaced the public sector as the main engine of investment many decades ago. The markets have a far greater role to play in mobilizing savings and channelling them towards productive investments. The Planning Commission stared irrelevance in the face, even though it did try to reinvent itself as a manager of social sector schemes. The Niti Aayog should notand cannotbe a resource allocator. It will be better placed to be an adviser. What does that precisely mean? The new institution should identify the binding constraints on economic development on a national scale: infrastructure, energy, water, education, environment and food production, for example. It should then advise the political system what can be done to address these constraints over the long term. And it should not try to micro manage government social sector schemes, as the previous denizens of Yojana Bhavan were wont to do in a failed bid to keep their organization relevant.

The style of functioning has to change as well. The press release announcing the formation of the Niti Aayog mentions cooperative federalism, a term that can be either meaningful or vacuous, depending on what is made of it. The Planning Commission treated elected chief ministers as courtiers who had to fly to New Delhi to ask for funds. Compare that with the Finance Commission, that goes to state capitals for meetings rather than summoning chief ministers to New Delhi. Modi has said that he wants chief ministers to be his partners. This belief should be reflected in the way the Niti Aayog functions. But what beyond that? The new institutionwhich once again has no constitutional statusneeds to work in tandem with constitutional institutions such as the Finance Commission and the Interstate Council if a new federal culture has to evolve.

The former decides how national tax collections should be shared with the states. The 14th Finance Commission under the chairmanship of Y.V. Reddy would do well to ask New Delhi to transfer money to states with no strings attached. The Interstate Council can be a deliberative body that sorts out the bargaining issues between states that are at different levels of development or have different economic structures. The Niti Aayog should plug into these discussions as an influential advisory body.

The Niti Aayog can be a successful innovation as long as such details are tackled. There is as yet no clarity on its purpose. We hope the Modi government clears the fog in the months ahead. The big danger would otherwise be that the Niti Aayog will become a Planning Commission by another name: outdated, imperious and meddlesome.",,,
208,,"About 180 years ago, in 1837, popular Danish author Hans Christian Andersen wrote the famous short story, The Emperors New Clothes. The story reminds us of the duties of advisers to the king, who are expected to present a clear picture to the king, and give fair and frank advice, without fear or favour. It is pertinent to revisit the story now when the Narendra Modi government is celebrating three years in office. One of the key decisions taken by the government on assumption of office was to dismantle the Planning Commission, and replace it with a new body, the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog. NITI Aayog was expected to act as the principal government think tank and adviser to the Prime Minister on key policy issues, which can really transform India. The Planning Commission was a non-legislative body, with significant powers to allocate finances to states, but marred by bureaucratic processes and devoid of fresh thinking. It failed to keep its ear to the ground, and did not take into account the divergent demands and capacities of states. The creation of NITI Aayog was expected to be a game changer, to infuse new vigour and rigour in the policy planning process, involve key stakeholders, and address the failures of the previous plan body. One anticipated that it would prioritize the challenges faced by the economy and hit the ground running to address them in a transformational manner.

During the last two-and-a-half years, NITI Aayog has worked on several agendas, such as the promotion of digital payments, reforms in agriculture, education and railways, helping states undertake social sector reforms. While all these issues were important, and the suggestions made by NITI Aayog critical, it appears that the institutions agenda and priorities are being set by government diktat rather than an organic, independent thought process. Often, it risked acting as a government mouthpiece and failed to be the transformational catalyst that many, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wanted it to be. For instance, while recognizing the importance of competition, it walked with the government on promoting digital payments through select entities, and kept mum when government policies distorted competition. NITI Aayog is yet to institutionalize a checks and balances mechanism to caution the government about the claims it makes, and apprise policymakers of the ground realities. While there have been a few exceptions, like Bibek Debroys suggestion on taxing farmers income, which challenged the governments stand on the issue, such instances have been rare. NITI Aayog recently released a draft three-year action agenda, which is part of a 15-year vision and seven-year strategy document. Other documents have not been released in the public domain as yet. True to NITI Aayogs diffused working approach, the action agenda covers a wide range of issues, including the fiscal framework, agriculture, industry, services, transport, digital connectivity, public private partnership, energy, science, technology, governance, taxation, competition, environment, forests and water.
Such a wide-ranging approach is not what one would expect when dealing with imminent challenges. For example, while covering pertinent issues and providing important recommendations such as Price Deficiency Payment"" to remove distortions in the existing minimum support price mechanism in the farm sector, there is limited clarity on how, by whom, and the timelines within which such suggestions would be implemented. The recommendations have no common binding theme, and theres an absence of prioritization.

Rather than a document infusing fresh thinking, the action agenda appears more like a document collating several policy-related recommendations provided by experts and government-formulated committees over the years. It puts limited or negligible focus on implementation challenges, bureaucratic reforms and government-citizen interaction, which is core to several good ideas remaining on paper and being left unimplemented.",,,
209,,"Rather than focusing on policy-level recommendations, NITI Aayog would have done better had it dealt with implementation-related challenges. A clear action agenda on how policies should be implemented, the creation of a feedback loop, taking into account changes on the ground, and fixing accountability of babus, would have been welcome. In addition, it should have focused on process reforms. While many of its recommendations, such as the creation of coastal employment zones, are interesting, the costs of implementing such recommendations must be compared with expected benefits in the medium term. A comparison of the costs and benefits of different policy alternatives should be made mandatory before policy recommendations are made. ",,,
210,,"On September 25, 2014, the Indian government announced the Make in India initiative to encourage manufacturing in India and galvanize the economy with dedicated investments in manufacturing and services. Immediately after the launch, investment commitments worth croreswere announced. In 2015, India emerged as the top destination for foreign direct investment, surpassing the U.S. and China. In line with the national programme, States too launched their own initiatives. Five years later, as we brace for another Union Budget, it would be appropriate to take stock of the much-hyped initiative as the economy in general, and the manufacturing sector in particular, is on a slippery slope. The Make in India idea is not new. Factory production has a long history in the country. This initiative, however, set an ambitious goal of making India a global manufacturing hub. To achieve this goal, targets were identified and policies outlined. The three major objectives were: (a) to increase the manufacturing sectors growth rate to 12-14% per annum in order to increase the sectors share in the economy; (b) to create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022; and (c) to ensure that the manufacturing sectors contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (revised to 2025) from the current 16%. The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital. Given that big-ticket projects for grand initiatives such as Make in India have long gestation periods and lag effects, assessments of such initiatives can be premature. Also, governments often use the excuse of inheriting an economy riddled with macroeconomic problems, and demand more time to set things right. This is an argument that the current government invokes frequently. However, five years is a reasonable time period to assess the direction and magnitude of outcomes. As the policy changes were intended to usher growth in three key variables of the manufacturing sector  investments, output, and employment growth  an examination of these will help us gauge the success of the policy.

The last five years witnessed slow growth of investment in the economy. This is more so when we consider capital investments in the manufacturing sector. Gross fixed capital formation of the private sector, a measure of aggregate investment, declined to 28.6% of GDP in 2017-18 from 31.3% in 2013-14 (Economic Survey 2018-19). Interestingly, though the public sectors share remained more or less the same during this period, the private sectors share declined from 24.2% to 21.5%. Part of this problem can be attributed to the decline in the savings rate in the economy. Household savings have declined, while the private corporate sectors savings have increased. Thus we find a scenario where the private sectors savings have increased, but investments have decreased, despite policy measures to provide a good investment climate. With regard to output growth, we find that the monthly index of industrial production pertaining to manufacturing has registered double-digit growth rates only on two occasions during the period April 2012 to November 2019. In fact, data show that for a majority of the months, it was 3% or below and even negative for some months. Needless to say, negative growth implies contraction of the sector. Thus, we are clearly waiting for growth to arrive.

Regarding employment growth, we have witnessed questions being raised over the governments delay in releasing data as well as its attempts to revise existing data collection mechanisms. The crux of the debate has been that employment, especially industrial employment, has not grown to keep pace with the rate of new entries into the labour market.

Thus on all three counts, Make in India has failed. Accusing the previous governments of policy paralysis, the NDA government announced a slew of policies with catchy slogans. This has resulted in an era of never-ending scheme announcements. Make in India is a good example of a continuous stream of scheme announcements. The announcements had two major lacunae. First, the bulk of these schemes relied too much on foreign capital for investments and global markets for produce. This created an inbuilt uncertainty, as domestic production had to be planned according to the demand and supply conditions elsewhere. Second, policymakers neglected the third deficit in the economy, which is implementation. While economists worry mostly about budget and fiscal deficit, policy implementers need to take into account the implications of implementation deficit in their decisions. The result of such a policy oversight is evident in the large number of stalled projects in India. The spate of policy announcements without having the preparedness to implement them is policy casualness. Make in India has been plagued by a large number of under-prepared initiatives.

The question that begs an answer is, why did Make in India fail? There are three reasons. First, it set out too ambitious growth rates for the manufacturing sector to achieve. An annual growth rate of 12-14% is well beyond the capacity of the industrial sector. Historically India has not achieved it and to expect to build capabilities for such a quantum jump is perhaps an enormous overestimation of the implementation capacity of the government. Second, the initiative brought in too many sectors into its fold. This led to a loss of policy focus. Further, it was seen as a policy devoid of any understanding of the comparative advantages of the domestic economy. Third, given the uncertainties of the global economy and ever-rising trade protectionism, the initiative was spectacularly ill-timed.

Make in India is a policy initiative with inbuilt inconsistencies. The bundle of contradictions unfold when we examine the incongruity of swadeshi products being made with foreign capital. This has led to a scenario where there is a quantum jump in the ease of doing business ranking, but investments are still to arrive. The economy needs much more than policy window dressing for increasing manufacturing activity. The government must realise that industrialisation cannot be kick-started by a series of bills in Parliament and hosting investors meets.",,,
211,,"""Make in India"" was launched in September 2014. On his website (pmindia.gov.in), the prime minister explains that ""since years policy-makers have been debating how to give an impetus to manufacturing in India and make India a Global Manufacturing Hub. But it is Narendra Modi, who within a matter of months, launched the Make in India campaign to facilitate investment, foster innovation, enhance skill development, protect intellectual property & build best in class manufacturing infrastructure. Manufacturing is important because it is the only way through which low-income nations can transition to middle and then high-income ones. There is no other pathway that we know of for rural and agrarian economies to become developed nations except first through light manufacturing (garments mainly), then more complex assembly before moving to high technology. It is a fact that India does a bit of all of the above, but as the prime ministers note indicates, the most important element is manufacturing.

In 2014, the share of manufacturing in Indias Gross Domestic Product was 15%. Last year, it fell to 14%. 'Make in India"" has failed and it has been over five years since it was put into place. To give a comparison of where India stands and what the failure means, lets have a look at some other nations. China, which we like comparing ourselves to, has an economy more than 5 times the size of Indias. Manufacturings share of GDP is at 29% (double that of Indias) and has remained there in the period of 2014-2020. Vietnam is 16% and has gone up from 13% when we launched Make in India. Sri Lanka is at 16%. Thailand (27%), Indonesia (19%), Phillippines (19%), Malaysia (21%), Singapore (20%). In Europe, Germany is at 20%, which is not surprising because it has one of the worlds biggest automobile industries. This is the second stage of industrial development, after garments. In the same period as Make in India, Bangladeshs share of manufacturing has risen from 16% to 18%. Bangladeshs overall GDP is growing at 8% per year, much faster than India. And the surprising thing is that in this period, Bangladeshs garments exports have gone to US$ 38 billion. India has fallen from $18 billion to $16 billion. Garments are important because large numbers of semi-skilled workers are employed and especially women. In the around 5,000 garments manufacturing units in Bangladesh, 85% of the employees are women. Even Vietnam exports more garments in dollar terms than India, which has long had a lead in this industry but has given it up in recent years.

Manufacturing is a full-time job with a fixed salary and therefore it is the sort of work that is preferred by people to part-time labour or making pakoras. Why has India failed at developing this? My response is that ""Make in India"" is not really a strategy, it is a logo and some words and that by itself is meaningless. Manufacturing comes to places where you have semi-skilled workers. The quality of education in China is many a time superior to India, as those of us who have been there and interacted with their workers know. It is more expensive to set up manufacturing in China because the cost of labour is higher. Despite that, Chinas share of manufacturing has not fallen in the five years that ""Make in India"" has been promoted.

The prime minister says the goal is to make India a $5 trillion economy. That is in itself not really a goal. Indias GDP will eventually reach that figure sooner or later. The question to be asked is how soon can it get there and what can the government do to quicken the pace? Those are the only important and relevant points. Here it is unclear what the answer is.

Modis strategy to redesign Indias economy was ""Make in India"", but that has flopped. In fact, he doesnt even refer to it as much any longer if I am not mistaken. All of the data on that website that the PMs office runs refers only to data from 2014 and has not even been updated.

We need an acknowledgement that this strategy has failed and that we need to develop a new one unless we are fine with a further decline in manufacturing. I do not think that is an acceptable outcome whether or not one is an admirer of the prime minister.",,,
212,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modis Make in India initiative, to my mind, has been one of the most significant, structured and outcome-oriented policy initiatives by any Indian government in recent years. It was, unlike many similar initiatives in the past, well structured, properly thought through, had an identified set of priorities (originally 16 sectors, now grown to 25) and focussed on the key issue dogging all inbound foreign direct investments in India  the ease (or rather, the lack of) doing business in India. It was also particularly well-timed. The programme itself was formally introduced on September 25, 2014, but Modi had outlined it a month earlier. In his first Independence Day speech on August 15, 2014, Modi said, I want to tell the people of the whole world: Come, make in India. Come and manufacture in India. We have skill, talent, discipline and the desire to do something. We want to give the world an opportunity that come make in India. The timing was near perfect. The Chinese growth engine had started slowing. Besides, new trade-related tensions between the worlds two biggest economies  the US and China  were giving jitters to investors worldwide. They were looking for a safe hedge bet against potential turmoil in their key manufacturing base, China. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with a strong, pro-business image, had just burst on the scene, talking the talk that investors love to hear, and whats more having the absolute electoral mandate to enable him to walk the talk as well, without the many pressures of coalition dharma which his predecessor had to face.

The Make in India initiative, when it took off, had ticked all the right boxes. The policy promised to clear the red tape that shrouded any potential inbound investor, create world-class infrastructure required by modern manufacturing industry, and bring in policies that helped foster a climate of innovation and, importantly, protect the intellectual property that resulted from such innovation, something that global investors had little faith in as far as China was concerned.

So, we had a plan, it was workable and it was well-timed. Investors, should, logically, have been beating a path to India to set up mega manufacturing plants to supply the world. But has the Make in India programme achieved what it set out to do?

Five years down the line, the picture is a bit muddled. True, in FDI terms, India is among the worlds top destinations, garnering inflows of $49 billion in calendar 2019, according to UNCTAD. India now accounts for 85 per cent of all FDI coming into South Asia (but then our competitors in the region are Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan!).

But FDI statistics include inflows into the capital markets, which still continue to account for the lions share of capital flows. Statistics on specific, manufacturing sector FDI flows are a bit harder to come by. Manufacturing FDI was around $8 billion in 2018-19, accounting for less than a quarter of the total inflows.

E-commerce, which has nothing to do with either manufacturing or Make in India, is one of the key sectors for FDI.

In some sectors in particular, Make in India appears to be doing exceedingly well. There are over a 100 mobile phone manufacturers in India and market leader Samsung last year upped one of its largest manufacturing set-ups from China and moved it to Noida in Uttar Pradesh. Apple and Xiaomi are also invested seriously in Indian manufacturing capacity.",,,
213,,"But Judged from the yardstick of what it set out to achieve, Make in India is at best still a work in progress. The key stated outcomes were to increase the share of the manufacturing sector to 25 per cent of GDP and to create a 100 million additional jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2022. Clearly, both have not happened, and going by the increasingly gloomy predictions for GDP growth, unlikely to happen by the target year. Manufacturings share of GDP, currently a shade under 15 per cent, is not likely to increase significantly over the next two years. And jobs  particularly relatively better paid, stable, manufacturing jobs  continue to be a chimera.

Why hasnt Make in India worked? To understand this, we need to understand why companies invest outside their home geographies. Looking at our companies is a good place to start. Last year, Indian companies invested nearly $12 billion as FDI in other countries, and India is now one of the top 20 origin countries for global FDI.

Why did they do it? Essentially, there are just three or four factors which drive corporates into significantly increasing their risk exposure by venturing into a foreign land. The first and biggest push factor is market access. If the rules are such that you cannot fully access a coveted market without investing in it, companies will invest. That is why Tata Steel bought Corus, for instance.

The second factor is acquiring technology. Again, this was a big factor in some of the big Indian FDIs in recent years  Tata Steel wanted technology for special steels, Tata Motors bough Jaguar Land Rover for its world class technology and design capability, and so on.

The third factor is acquiring talent. In the IT space for instance, a push-pull combination of tougher visa rules and availability of high-end talent, and access-limiting restrictions, particularly for government orders, has led to Indian IT giants like TCS, Infosys et al creating some serious capacity in the US.

The final factor is securing raw material and inputs for your domestic business. That is why Adani and Tata have bought mineral and coal mines abroad and why ONGC is making investments in oil and gas resources.

We need to ensure that the same factors apply in reverse as well. We have to make market access tougher via a pure trade route; we need to ensure that Indian innovation attracts global investment (its already happening in the start-up space); we need to ensure that our talent does not migrate abroad but is headhunted at home; and we need to ensure that our precious natural resources are value-added at home.

Unless we tweak our policies to get these right, the Make in India lion cannot hope to be the king of his own jungle.",,,
214,,"The Narendra Modi governments flagship Make in India"" programme is not the first attempt to goose Indian manufacturing. It will not be the last, no matter who wins the 2019 elections. Scrying the entrails of past policy pushes is helpful. It throws up some constant truths. Import substitution hasnt worked and is unlikely to do so. Industrial policies can introduce significant distortions. Policy decisions made in New Delhi often dont survive the journey to manufacturing plants. A new working paper by Rajesh Raj S.N., Kunal Sen and Sabyasachi Kar, Unmaking Make in India"": Weak governance, good deals and their economic impact, provides interesting insights into that last point. Since its inception in 2003, the World Banks Doing Business report has been perhaps the most popular yardstick by which to measure the state-business relationship. Much was made of Indias jumping 30 ranks to 100th position in last years report. It is a laudable achievement as far as it goes, speaking to the Modi governments attempts to clear up regulatory cholesterol and put new, effective systems in place. In 2015, however, Mary Hallward-Driemeier and Lant Pritchett had a subversive take on the impact of such policy action in their paper, How business is done in the developing world: deals versus rules. Looking at firm-level data from the World Banks enterprise surveys (ES)as opposed to the Doing Business reports which survey lawyers, consultants, bureaucrats and so onthey found a vast gulf between de jure regulatory frameworks and de facto realities. Corruption and deal-making between the state and businesses meant that across the nations studied, a handful of companies could obtain clearances and permissions far faster than the law suggested, while other companies took far longer than prescribed.

Raj, Sen and Kar mine this perspective further, looking at 2013-14 ES data across Indian states. In line with Hallward-Driemeier and Pritchett, they find a substantial difference between the de jure number of days required for a business to get an operating license or construction permit, and the de facto reality. So far, as expected. In fact, in the majority of states, the mean and median de facto values are lowersometimes substantially sothan the regulations suggest. Does this mean that governance mechanisms are particularly efficient in these states? Not quite. They find a wide variance in firms within-state experiences. For instance, in Bihar, the 10th percentile set of firms reports obtaining an operating license in one day, while 90th percentile set of firms reports obtaining a license in 90 days."" This makes it clear that a companys regulatory experience is a product of its deal-making ability, not of a neutral governance mechanism. Here is where it gets interesting: Raj, Sen and Kar also find that firms in states with weaker capacity and poorer governance, as defined by a handful of proxy measures, are able to secure better dealsand that in most states, good deals go to the least productive firms.

The implications for Indian industry and development are obvious and troubling. For firms, Indias administratively weakest states are the most tempting targets for regulatory capture that is likely to skew the inclusive, broad-based growth they need. The natural advantage large companies have over upstart competitors in securing sweetheart deals also means that competitionand the innovation and productivity growth that comes with itare undercut. There is thus efficiency loss when it comes to business growth pushing broader economic growth and development. By enriching politicians and bureaucrats, such deal-making and regulatory capture also creates structural disincentives for improving state capacity. In the absence of such capacity, the value of politicians as middlemen who can help firms cut in line or secure public goods for citizens rises. This, in turn, enables more deal-making, perpetuating the cycle.

In The Republic Of Beliefs: A New Approach To Law And Economics, Kaushik Basu has written that the effectiveness of laws rests to a significant extent on the belief among citizens of a states ability to enforce themthat is, buying into a rational expectation of behaviour in accordance with the law. Visible regulatory capture and lack of state capacity make such belief hard to buy into. There is also another factor at play here. To a significant extent, caste and kin networks remain important vectors of social, economic and political activity. This is a reality that doesnt always mesh easily with Indias regulatory and legal framework. These are fundamental problems that define the business-state relationship in India, and extend considerably beyond it. Plainly, improving the regulatory framework is no panacea. Breaking the cycle will take far deeper transformations.",,,
215,,"Indias next government is poised to inherit a troubled economy. Several indicators point to a reduction in demand, including for packaged consumer goods and two-wheelers which had earlier seen consistent growth. Conscientious policymakers have consequently begun to highlight that this lack of demand is a symptom of a deeper malaisenamely, lack of income growth for a majority of Indians. A vicious cycle like this can only be remedied by resuscitating economic activity wherever possible. As far as manufacturing is concerned, the Make in India"" programme has thus far been unsuccessful in catalysing such activity. A large thrust of Make in India"" has been on localizing mobile phone manufacturing. Trade metrics, however, paint a dismal picture. Broadly, mobile manufacturing entails two stepsthe higher-value activity of making components and the lower-value assembly of these. Traders can import parts and assemble them locally, or import ready-to-use phones, depending on relative advantages under prevailing import duty regimes. While imports of fully-built mobile phones have reduced substantially over the last five years, imports of components has risen manifold. Specifically, imports of ready-to-use phones on which India imposes 20% duty have fallen 80% from ?47,439 crore in 2014-15 to ?9,592 crore in 2018-19 (until February). However, imports of mobile components rose by around 116% from ?47,011 crore in 2014-15 to ?1.02 trillion in 2018-19 (until February). It thus seems an Assemble in India"" paradigm has emerged that serves the interests of companies that only wish to make nominal investments in local supply chains for trading profits, and not for manufacturing value addition.Typically, assembly does not account for more than 5-6% of a smartphones value. Lack of local value addition is worrying not just because it militates against the logic of Make in India"", but because its directly related to lack of income growth in Indias economy.

A sharp contraction in exports of mobile phones from India worsens the outlined challenges. Mobile phone exports peaked in 2012-13 at ?14,487 crore. By 2018-19, they had fallen to under ?9,000 crore. That is, imported parts were not used to make complete products for re-export. Instead, these component imports fuelled a trading and assembly ecosystem which contributes very little value locally. Indian consumption demand, then, is not doing much to drive domestic income growth. Evidently, Make in India"" has been limited in ambition and scope. Its vision follows from an outsize focus on erecting tariff barriers to protect domestic industry, instead of incentivizing manufacturing competitiveness through tax breaks, infrastructural support and other structural interventions. A similar tariff-led approach failed to catalyse the local manufacture of solar cells, the technologies of which have evolved rapidly like phone technologies. Keeping up with the technology curve requires serious investments in local research and development, which high-tariff regimes do not encourage.

Indias tariff-led approach is reminiscent of a bygone era of industrial policies. However, greater specialization of industrial production today means that countries must adopt holistic policies that address supply chain complexities. Instead, in 2016, India chose to adopt a simplistic Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) under Make in India"", to levy duties on component imports hoping to stem related merchandise inflows. The PMP is a sequential application of tariffs that are raised gradually for different mobile phone components. Lower-value parts such as battery packs and chargers are sought to be localized first, followed by higher-value components like display screens and cameras. However, the disadvantages of manufacturing in India, including acute infrastructural deficits, cannot be offset by high tariffs alone. This is already visible in import statistics relating to low-value components covered under the PMPs first phase. More such components are being imported at cheaper rates, perhaps an indication of the large surplus capacity of Chinese companies, which dominate the Indian smartphone market.

It could be argued that Chinese companies cannot similarly reduce costs on higher-value components. However, both the European Union and Japan have recently filed consultation requests at the World Trade Organization on the tariffs imposed by India on several ICT products, including ready-to-use phones and several assembly components covered under the PMP. Such consultations constitute the first step towards initiation of disputes at the WTO. Given that India had already committed to keeping its tariff levels at zero on such products prior to the notification of PMP, the programme may have a short shelf life. It is also worth highlighting the strategic opportunity India currently enjoys, wherein it can leverage the ongoing trade spat between the US and China to attract firms that may be looking to hedge bets and shift some manufacturing capacity out of China. However, lacklustre inward investment in manufacturing shows that such re-orientation is contingent on a re-balancing of incentives and tariffs under Make in India"". The next government could begin to address such concerns with an immediate impact assessment of the PMP, particularly since the success of Make in India"" and income growth in the economy are correlated.",,,
216,,"On his website (pmindia.gov.in), the Prime Minister explains, since years policy-makers have been debating how to give an impetus to manufacturing in India and make India a Global Manufacturing Hub. But it is Narendra Modi, who within a matter of months, launched the Make in India campaign to facilitate investment, foster innovation, enhance skill development, protect intellectual property & build best in class manufacturing infrastructure. Manufacturing is important because it is the only way in which low income nations can transition to middle and then high-income ones. There is no other pathway that we know of for rural and agrarian economies to become developed nations except first through light manufacturing (garments mainly), then more complex assembly before moving to high technology. It is a fact that India does a bit of all of the above, but as the Prime Ministers note indicates, the most important element is manufacturing.


In 2014, the share of manufacturing in Indias Gross Domestic Product was 15%. Last year it fell to 14%.

Make in India has failed and it has been over five years since it was put into place.

To give a comparison of where India stands and what the failure means, lets have a look at some other nations. China, which we like comparing ourselves to has an economy which is more than five times the size of Indias. Manufacturings share in Chinas GDP is at 29% (double that of Indias) and has remained there in the period of 2014-2020. Vietnam is 16% and has gone up from 13% when we launched Make in India. Sri Lanka is at 16%. Thailand (27%), Indonesia (19%), Phillippines (19%), Malaysia (21%), even Singapore (20%) has a more dominant manufacturing sector. In Europe, Germany is at 20%, which is not surprising because it has one of the worlds biggest automobile industries. This is the second stage of industrial development, after garments.

In the same period as Make in India, Bangladeshs share of manufacturing has risen from 16% to 18%.

Bangladeshs GDP overall is growing at 8% per year, much faster than India. And the surprising thing is that in this period Bangladeshs garments exports have gone up to US$ 38 billion. India has fallen from $18 billion to $16 billion.

Garments are important because large numbers of semi-skilled workers are employed and especially women. In the around 5,000 garments manufacturing units in Bangladesh, 85% of the employees are women.

Even Vietnam exports more garments in dollar terms than India, which has long had a lead in this industry but has given it up in recent years.

Manufacturing is a full-time job with a fixed salary and therefore it is the sort of work that is preferred by people to part time labour or making pakoras. Why has India failed at developing this? My response is that Make in India is not really a strategy, it is a logo and some words and that by itself is meaningless. Manufacturing comes to places where you have semi-skilled workers. The quality of education in China is many times superior to India, as those of us who have been there and interacted with their workers know. It is more expensive to set up manufacturing in China because the cost of labour is higher. But despite that Chinas share of manufacturing has not fallen in the five years that Make in India has been promoted.

The Prime Minister says that the goal is to make India a $5 trillion economy. That is in itself not really a goal.

Indias GDP will eventually reach that figure sooner or later. The question to be asked is how soon can it get there and what can the government do to quicken the pace? Those are the only important and relevant points.

Here it is unclear what the answer is.

Modis strategy to redesign Indias economy was Make in India, but that has flopped. In fact, he doesnt even refer to it as much any longer, if I am not mistaken. All of the data on that website that the PMs office runs https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/major_initiatives/make-in-india/ refers only to data from 2014 and has not even been updated.

We need an acknowledgement that this strategy has failed and that we need to develop a new one, unless we are fine with further decline in manufacturing.

I do not think that is an acceptable outcome whether or not one is an admirer of the Prime Minister.",,,

218,,"The Global Innovation Index, brought out by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, in association with Cornell University and Instead, offers an opportunity to assess how a country compares with its peers. India can cheer that it has moved up four positions and is now placed 48th, within the top 50, out of 131. China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Japan are ahead of India in Asia. No surprise. But so are Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. With the worlds largest cohort of young people of college-going age, who can be trained in science, engineering, technology, Maths and the creative arts, India can and should be among world leaders in innovation. But how to reach there? Switzerland is at the top of the index. It is not a leading country in venture capital spending. The US and China spend far more, per capita. That is the whole point: innovation is not a mechanical result of spending more. The way the index is constructed is as an average of innovation inputs and innovation outputs. Inputs are institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, and business sophistication. Innovation outputs are: knowledge and technology outputs and creative outputs. Presumably many entrepreneurs in the US had access to the different technologies  basic telecom, touchscreen, LCD display panels, ability to develop applications  that Steve Jobs put together to launch the iPhone, but it took some entrepreneurial genius to do what he did. Without the technology, the fruit of sustained investment in R&D, the phone would not have been possible. Without an eye for design, aesthetics and consumer needs, the phone could not have been designed as it came out. Without the business acumen to create an App Store that Apple controlled completely, the phone could not have become a steady stream of income beyond the sale proceeds of the phone.

Beyond R&D, the ability to think big and think bold, venture capital that backs entrepreneurial vision and a regulatory and operating ecosystem that lets people focus on business are imperative for innovation.",,,
219,,"Prime MinisterNarendra Modilaunched the Make in India campaign on September 25, 2014 with these words: I tell the world, Make in India. Sell anywhere but manufacture here. Modi aspired to emulate China  a country he had visited many times as Gujarat chief minister  in attracting foreign investment to industrialise India. The objective was, officially, to increase the manufacturing sectors growth rate to 12-14 per cent per annum in order to increase this sectors share in the economy from 16 to 25 per cent of the GDP by 2022  and to create 100 million additional jobs by then. Five years later, this policy has produced contrasting results. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has increased from $16 billion in 2013-14 to $36 billion in 2015-16. But this remarkable achievement needs to be qualified from two standpoints. First, FDIs have plateaued since 2016 and second, they are not contributing to Indias industrialisation. FDIs in the manufacturing sector, in fact, are on the wane. In 2017-18, they were just above $7 billion , as against $9.6 billion in 2014-15. Services cornered most of the FDIs  $23.5 billion, more than three times that of the manufacturing sector. This is a clear reflection of the the Indian economys traditional strong points, where computer services, for instance, are remarkably developed. But can a country rely on services without developing an industrial base? The response is clearly no and this is why Make in India was initiated.

The idea, then, was to promote export-led growth: Foreign investors were invited to make in India, not necessarily for India. But few investors have been attracted by this prospect, and Indias share in the global exports of manufactured products remains around 2 per cent  Chinas is around 18 per cent. Why has Make in India failed to deliver? First, a large fraction of the Indian FDI is neither foreign nor direct but comes from Mauritius-based shell companies. Indian tax authorities suspected that most of these investments were black money from India, which was routed via Mauritius. Second, the productivity of Indian factories is low. According to a McKinsey report, workers in Indias manufacturing sector are almost four and five times less productive, on average, than their counterparts in Thailand and China. This is not just because of insufficient skills, but also because the size of the industrial units is too small for attaining economies of scale, investing in modern equipment and developing supply chains. Why are companies small? Partly by choice, because labour regulations are more complicated for plants with more than 100 employees. Government approval is required under the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 before laying off any employee and the Contract Labour Act of 1970 requires government and employee approval for simple changes in an employees job description or duties.

Infrastructure is also a problem area. Although electricity costs are about the same in India and China, power outages are much higher in India. Moreover, transportation takes much more time in India. According to Google Maps, it takes about 12.5 hours to travel the 1,213 km distance between Beijing to Shanghai. A Delhi to Mumbai trip of 1,414 km, via National Highway 48, in contrast, takes about 22 hours. Average speeds in China are about 100 km per hour, while in India, they are about 60 km per hour. Railways in India have saturated while Indian ports have constantly been outperformed by many Asian countries. The 2016 World Banks Global Performance Index ranked India 35th among 160 countries. Singapore was ranked fifth, China 25th and Malaysia 32nd. The average ship turnaround time in Singapore was less than a day; in India, it was 2.04 days.

Bureaucratic procedures and corruption continue to make India less attractive for investors. It has made progress in the World Banks Ease of Doing Business index, but even then, is ranked 77 among 190 countries. India ranks 78 out of 180 countries in Transparency Internationals Corruption Perception Index. To acquire land to build a plant, for instance, remains difficult. India has slipped 10 places in the latest annual Global Competitiveness Index compiled by Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF).

There was clearly a contradiction in the attempt to attract foreign investors to Make in India before completing the reforms of labour and land acquisition laws. Liberalisation is not the panacea for all that ails the economy, but it is a prerequisite if India intends to follow an export-oriented growth pattern.

A significant move in this direction was made last month with the reduction of the company tax from about 35 to about 25 per cent (at least on paper), a rate comparable with most of Indias neighbours. This reform is also consistent with the governments effort to compete with South East Asian countries, in particular, to attract FDIs. This competition has acquired a new dimension in the context of the US-China trade dispute. After the Trump administration increases tariffs on Chinese exports to the US, several companies will shift their plants from China to other Asian countries. Some of them have already done so. According to the Japanese financial firm Nomura, only three of the 56 companies that decided to relocate from China moved to India. Of them, Foxconn is a major player which will be now assembling its top-end iPhones in India. Whether other big multinationals will begin to show interest at manufacturing in India remains to be seen.

But India will have to face another external challenge too as it sees capital fleeing the country. The net outflow of capital has jumped as the rupee has dropped from 54 a dollar in 2013 to more than 70 to a dollar in 2019, at a time when oil is becoming more expensive.",,,
220,,"There is now a plethora of evidence that the economy has been cooling down over the last three years. Official data was slow to pick up the trend, but data from private sources on indicators such as sales of consumer durables and automobiles clearly show that it is largely a result of declining demand, particularly in rural areas. The Union budget presented on 5 July was expected to address some of these concerns. However, it was a missed opportunity, with no effort being made to increase spending in rural areas, except for the electoral promise of cash transfer to farmers. Also disappointing was the governments approach in dealing with most rural development programmes. These not only directly contribute to creating rural infrastructure and assets, but also indirectly help increase rural demand and employment. For most of these programmes, the budget expenditure was kept constant or lowered. Of particular importance is the all-India scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Its budget allocation has fallen compared to the revised expenditure of last year, and is insufficient, given the wage-payment arrears.

The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) showed apathy towards the rural and agricultural sectors during its first term in government, and in many ways is continuing the flawed policies of the second term of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The UPA, which enacted MGNREGA and reaped political dividends for its successful rollout during its first term, contributed to the weakening of the programme as well as the changing of its basic character. The government kept the budget allocation low and created administrative bottlenecks that stifled the programme. This trend has continued under the NDA. This alliance also altered the basic character of the scheme. MGNREGA was envisaged as a provider of rural employment to casual workers at government-mandated minimum wages set above market wages. This was the case at its 2006 launch. The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) has been tracking wages received by casual workers employed under MGNREGA and private markets since 2007-08, when it introduced a separate category for MGNREGA work. This has been retained even in the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the report of which was released recently. In 2007-08, the second year of MGNREGA implementation, wages under the programme were 5% higher than market wages for rural male workers and 58% higher for rural female workers. This was one of the reasons that the programme attracted almost 50% female workers, in contrast to the trend of declining female workforce participation since 2004-05. By 2009-10, MGNREGA wages were only 90% of market wages for males, but 26% higher than market wages for females. By 2011-12, they were lower than market wages for both category of workers, but for females, they were close to market levels. The 2017-18 PLFS estimates show that private market wages for males were higher than MGNREGA wages by 74%, and female market wages were higher than MGNREGA wages by 21%. Clearly, no male worker is going to demand MGNREGA work when he can get a much higher daily wage with the same effort . However, women continue to demand and work under MGNREGA, though market wages are higher, because of non-availability of work and discrimination as well as exclusion from the private labour market. A peculiar result of this is the overwhelming participation of women in MGNREGA in southern states, where casual wages are higher in general, with Kerala reporting only female workers. However, many states, including Gujarat, did not report any MGNREGA work in 2017-18. Keeping MGNREGA wages significantly lower than market wages is a deliberate attempt to finish the programme. MGNREGA wages are less than half of the national minimum wage of ?375 per day (as on July 2018) proposed by an expert group. Even the Economic Survey presented on 4 July has a chapter on minimum wages, which argues in favour of keeping minimum wages at a sufficiently high level to reduce poverty and inequality.

At a time when the government is pushing for a minimum wage code, the largest government-run programme has been violating state minimum wages for almost a decade.

MGNREGA could have been the lifeline to revive the rural economy, which is in distress. However, the political slugfest and flawed policies of the government have led to a situation where MGNREGA, bereft of its original character, is unable to provide a stimulus to the rural economy, despite the strong evidence of it having pushed up rural wages and incomes during the first five years of its implementation. It also created rural infrastructure and provided much-needed employment to the countrys rural population. On 27 February 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Parliament that he would like MGNREGA to be a monument of failure, though he would not finish the programme for political reasons. This objective has been achieved, with the trend having started under the UPA-II regime.",,,
221,,"The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has been described by the World Bank as the largest antipoverty state-run employment-generation scheme in the world. It formed the cornerstone of the shift in the UPAs approach to development towards universalisation and entitlements, articulated in the National Common Minimum Programme. The idea of an employment guarantee was also central to theCongresss agenda in its 2004 election manifesto. The BJPs ascendance post-2014 raised several questions over the continuation of MGNREGA, especially in light of its welfare narrative distinguished from that of the Congress by way of its focus on empowerment, as opposed to a rights and entitlements focused agenda. Despite the BJPs ideological differences with the Congress over the approach to employment generation, it has made the highest-ever budgetary allocations to MGNREGA, with `550 billion allocated to the scheme for FY19, up from `480 billion in the previous year. The preceding three years witnessed the NDA increase budgetary allocation towards it.

Even though the UPA was led by the Congress, a left-of-centre political party, a key factor in ensuring that the NREGA, when passed in 2005, was not watered-down to adhere to neoliberal conceptions of social policy was the dependence of the UPA on Left Front parties. After 2004 elections, the UPA would not have secured the numbers to form a government without the support of parties like the CPI(M). Left Front parties enjoyed disproportionate policy influence in such a set-up until their decision to withdraw support from the UPA.

This influence was exercised by way of interventions played out through the UPA-Left Coordination Committee negotiations, a party political process. Moreover, UPA alliance partners like the RJD brought political leaders to the Centre like rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, who played the crucial role of a bridge between the fiscal conservatives and populists in the UPA.

MGNREGA was the flagship scheme among the many policy initiatives of the first term of the UPA. Its success and impact on rural India is believed to have carried the UPA to another term at the Centre. However, as the second term of the UPA (2009-14) became increasingly mired in corruption scandals, the existing issues in MGNREGAs implementation with states failing to provide employment, delaying and withholding wages, and corruption occurring due to a lack of proper social auditing and monitoring, were exacerbated by the UPAs overall image of policy paralysis and inaction.

According to Ashok Pankaj, upon reaching full acceleration in 2009-10 and 2010-11, (MGNREGS) decelerated in 2011-12 while the UPA was dilly-dallying with the idea of a cash transfer-based social protection programmes, aiming at 2014 parliamentary elections, and the shift in attention from MGNREGA to DBT is partly to blame for the slack implementation of the scheme during 2011-14. Systematically cutting funding for MGNREGA began in 2010, by way of caps on allocated funds, causing administrative failures like problems with wage payment and provision of employment. Its impact on the employment generated through the scheme was that the number of households that got jobs increased by 89.5% over a decade. But the number peaked at 5.49 crore in 2011 and has since declined steadily.

The right-wing BJP-led NDA came to power in 2014, with Narendra Modi as PM. The BJP commanded a majority in the Lok Sabha by itself, and was thus less beholden to coalition partners in formulating its policies. It also placed technology at the heart of its policy agenda, onboarding the UPAs DBT approach early on through its Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity, with a view to migrating towards a cash-based welfare setup. Some believe this unfortunately glosses over the roots of governance delivery failures like complex procedures, weak human resources and poor training.

While proposals to scale back MGNREGA had been discussed during the first year of Modi government, in light of its pro-business and investment-oriented approachhinged on a narrative of empowerment, exemplified by Make in India, Skill India, and Start-up India, etcas opposed to the entitlements and rights-oriented framework of the Congress, the NDA has made increasingly higher budgetary allocations to MGNREGA, with the figure for FY19 being the highest allocation till date, and has simultaneously not abandoned the programme.

But these allocations have followed the BJP learning from the adverse political consequences of initially attempting to strangulate MGNREGA through pointedly low allocations in the NDAs first two years. At the same time, the NDA has altered the focus of MGNREGA towards emphasising on top-down, target-driven, asset-creation, which is the polar opposite of the UPAs demand-driven job-creation regime focused on participatory decentralised development.

Ashok Pankaj argues there has been a sharp distinction in the nature of the programme pursued by the UPA and the NDA, which he describes as wage-focused against asset-focused, and target-focused at the cost of demand-focused, compromising the objective of participatory decentralised development.

But this asset fetishism, while not entirely undesirable, has nevertheless tilted the benefits of MGNREGA in favour of agriculturists, excluding landless rural labourer households that constitute a quarter of Indias rural population from accessing benefits of individual assets owing to their lack of land, and affecting job-creation.

The UPA had prioritised job-creation over asset-creation by mandating a wage-material expenditure ratio of 60:40 in the Act, which also mandated that four out of the eight works are to be labour-intensive.

Only a weak relationship exists between political will and the implementation of a scheme, especially in Indian context, since there is a lack of a one-to-one mapping between economic and social ideologies on either side of the political spectrum in India. While lying on two opposite ends of the political spectrum, the Congress and the BJP have followed broadly the same paths in the pursuit of neoliberal policy.

With Modi lending no personal ideological support to MGNREGA, the BJP has been forced to retain the scheme for fear of losing electoral support in rural India. The enhanced outlays, and mere tweaking the programmes attributes to justify its own ideological underpinnings, prove that political will cannot be seen as an important determinant of the implementation of MGNREGA in the case of the BJP.",,,
222,,"A record 4.89 crore persons belonging to 3.44 crore households sought work under theMahatma GandhiNational Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in May. This is against 3.18 crore persons from 2.26 crore households for the same month last year, when large parts of India were experiencing drought-like conditions. The current surge in MGNREGA work demand reflects a drought, not of water, but of jobs and incomes. And it seems to be coming mainly from migrant workers returning to their villages from cities and industrial centres post the COVID lockdown. Proof of it is the states where the number of households registering demand has shown the highest increase: Uttar Pradesh (299.3 per cent in May 2020 over May 2019), West Bengal (214.5 per cent), Odisha (113.5 per cent), Chhattisgarh (68.9 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (65.1 per cent) and Bihar (62.1 per cent). These are all labour exporting states. Whats now being seen is an extraordinary phenomenon of distress reverse migration from city to village. The lockdown hasnt hit the rural economy, more so agriculture, that badly. The MGNREGA has been generally viewed as a scheme that provides employment during the lean period for agriculture, thereby reducing seasonal labour migration from rural to urban areas. The demand for work, too, typically peaks in May-June before falling in the subsequent months coinciding with the main kharif cropping season. But this conventional pattern may not hold in the present scenario, where the primary demand driver will not be the landless agricultural labourer who would have little work after the kharif or rabi crop has been harvested. If the laid-off auto worker from Gurgaon-Manesar or erstwhile hotel employee in Mumbai is the one seeking employment under MGNREGA  and there is no way to gainfully engage them in agriculture  the schemes scope will have to be widened. To start with, the number of days of guaranteed employment to adult members of any rural household needs to be expanded beyond the existing 100 days. The returning migrant workers may, at some point, want to go back to jobs that paid better. But those jobs arent going to come back soon either.

This is where a rethink on the MGNREGAs basic design might be called for without compromising its objective. If the idea is to provide work to anybody demanding it, there should, in principle, be no restrictions on the kind of activities allowed under the scheme. The stipulation of a 60:40 wage-to-material cost ratio can also be relaxed. If higher material component helps in building more assets with durable quality, why cannot these projects qualify under the MGNREGA? Why tie it down to particular permitted works? What stops MGNREGA labour from being used even to undertake railway or national highway work? Any public work ultimately requires labour and so long as it is given on demand, the MGNREGA has fulfilled its purpose.",,,
223,,"Despite an acute funds crunch faced by the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme, the budgetary allocation for the 2020-2021 financial year (FY) has only been increased marginally, from Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 61,500 crore. This increase, however, when compared with the revised estimate of FY 2019-20, is actually 9.1% less. In 2019-20, the revised estimate was Rs 71,002 crore. For the last few years, rural distress has been visible across India. There has been a sharp rise in the number of people dependent on the rural employment scheme for their sustenance. The Centre, right now, is on the verge of running out of funds to run the scheme.

According to the schemes financial statement released last week, as many as 15 states are in the red. According to a report in The Hindu, more than 96% of the allocated money has already been spent or is needed to pay pending dues. Less than Rs 2,500 crore is left to sustain the scheme for the next two months, the report says.

The scheme has to still run on the earlier allocation until March end and the newly announced budgetary allocation will be available only from April 1.

According to the NREGA Sangarsha Morcha, a national platform of workers collectives, trade unions, organisations and individuals, an allocation of a minimum Rs 1 lakh crore is required to ensure a smooth running of the scheme. Explaining the breakdown of the figures and the rationale behind the estimate given by the organisation, NREGA Sangarsha Morcha, in its press note released on January 31, says with a projected labour at 270 crore person and considering Rs. 248 is paid per person per day on an average, an estimated Rs 66,960 crores would be needed to only pay wages. Among other expenditures, there are material components, which the organisation has studied to be around Rs 16,740 crores.

In the last five years, the organisation says nearly one-sixth of each years allocation have been pending wage liabilities. Assuming that the pending wages would be the same proportion going in to FY 2020-21, the component of pending wage liabilities is 79,515/6, which account to about Rs 13,252 crores. The total expenditure of Rs 92,767 crore and an additional average 10% inflation would amount to about Rs 1,20,050 crore.

Taking the budgetary distributions and the supplementary allocation of funds to the programme for the last few years into account, it can be deduced that though the demand for employment under the scheme has been on a steady rise in the past years, the government has failed to address it fully. This has only added to the pending liabilities.

In its press statement, Peoples Action for Employment Guarantee, a civil society collective has said, All eyes were on the Union Budget 2020-21 to see how the Central Government would leverage its only legislative mechanism to provide employment and alleviate rural distress i.e. the MGNREGA. And the result has been worse than expected, and deeply distressing. The statement further points to the BJP governments decision to reduce the budgetary allocation of MGNREGA by Rs 9,500 crore from its revised estimate of 2019-20. The reduction in the budgetary allocation is taking place when the minimum allocation needed to protect the MGNREGA as status quo is nearly Rs 85,927 crore. Responding to the budget, James Herenj of the Jharkhand NREGA Watch, a civil society initiative floated to ensure efficient implementation of the scheme said, The budget has not taken the dire requirement of the scheme into consideration. In Jharkhand alone, of the total 26 lakh labourers with active job cards, only about 20 thousand labourers have got 100 days job. This situation will only worsen in the coming years, Herenj says. In 2019-20, Herenj said Jharkhand could only ensure an average of 35 days work and around Rs. 83 crores are pending to be paid in wages. Almost all of those dependent on jobs under the MGNREGA are from Bahujan communities. Like, in Jharkhand, 41% belong to the Scheduled Tribes (ST) and the Scheduled Castes (SC) and the rest are from Other Backward Classes (OBC). This would be the case more or less in every state, Herenj added.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman took over two hours and forty minutes, the longest speech in 17 years, to present the budget. But the annual outlay for the MGNREGA  the only government programme providing direct employment  was not a part of her speech. Herenj says this pretty much sums up the governments intention and interest to run the scheme.",,,
224,,"The Goods and Services Tax regime completed three years on July 1. The concept of GST came in 2005 when the Vijay Kelkar-led task force submitted its report and recommended the replacement of all indirect taxes with GST. Even earlier, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha constituted a seven-member Expert Group on Taxation of Services as per his budget speech for FY2000-01. The expert group led by M Govinda Rao submitted its report in March 2001. The group made the first recommendation on GST. The dream became a reality when the new tax was introduced at the midnight of June 30 and July 1, 2017. It was introduced as the biggest tax reform for indirect taxes. But unfortunately, it has failed to live up to peoples expectations. To remove glitches, the government has made 697 changes in GST since its inception by issuing notifications related to rates, the amendment of rules and waiver of penalty. Besides this, 146 circulars and 19 orders have been issued so far on various issues.

It was expected that the introduction of GST would increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country because a simplified tax structure will eliminate the cascading effect of taxes and increase governments revenue. While there may be a set of complex factors that have led to a dip in growth, the fact is that the expected boost has not happened. The growth rate of GDP of Q4 of FY20 has declined to 3.1%. The growth rate of GDP for FY20 has fallen to 4.2%  the lowest in the last 11 years. The coding of goods under various Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN) brackets has always been a challenge for the GST council. Take this example. In the recent past, the Authority for Advanced Rulings (AAR)-Karnataka bench has said that 18% GST will be levied on parathas and roti will be taxed at 5% of GST slabs rate. The AAR has ruled that a paratha is different from a roti. The same problem arose with the rate of tax on hand sanitiser. The AAR-Goa bench established that alcohol-based hand sanitisers will be taxed at 18%. Hand sanitisers are essential in the Covid-19 battle. While the GST Council has made efforts to resolve such issues, the fact that they keep recurring is a sign of the weakness of the system. Various states were ready to hop on to the same boat on the condition that the central government would compensate their revenue loss for the first five years. Accordingly, a provision was made under section 7 of GST (Compensation to State) Act, 2017. As per the provision, the loss of revenue will be compensated at the end of every two months for five years. When states were fighting against the pandemic and struggling for revenue in the middle of the lockdown, the Centre did not release compensation money, which had not been paid since November 2019. The Centre only released Rs 36,400 crore on June 4, due to the states and Union territories for the period starting from December 2019 to February 2020. The government further released Rs 13,806 crore for March 2020 on July 27, and paid all dues for FY20. The amount for April-July for FY21 is still due. While states need the compensation, the Centre seems to lack the resources to meet its commitment on a consistent basis.

On the revenue front, there was an unofficial target to collect Rs 1 lakh crore GST every month. The average collection was Rs 89,885 crore in FY18, Rs 98,114 crore in FY19, though this improved to Rs 101,845 crore in FY20. The total revenue collection was Rs 7.19 lakh crore in the first eight months of FY18. The total revenue collection was Rs 11.77 lakh crore in FY19 and Rs 12.22 lakh crore in FY20.

There was no budget provision made by the central government for FY18. The revised estimate was made of Rs 4.44 lakh crore. But the actual realisation was Rs 4.42 lakh crore. The government had made a budget provision of Rs 7.43 lakh crore for FY19. The target was revised downward to Rs 6.43 lakh crore in the midterm budget review for FY19. However, the actual realisation was Rs 5.81 lakh crore. The government has made a budgeted estimate of Rs 7.61 lakh crore for the collection of GST for FY20 in the interim budget. However, finance minister Nirmala Sitharamans revised budget estimates to Rs 6.63 lakh crores in her maiden budget speech for FY20. The target was further revised to Rs 6.12 lakh crore. All these figures show a consistent overestimation of the collections. The government has already set a budgeted target of Rs 6.90 lakh crore for FY21. The collection for the first four months for FY21 is Rs 32,172 crore, Rs 62,151 crore, Rs 90,917 crore and Rs 87,422 crore respectively. The signs are clear. There will be a shortfall again, making the reality of GST more sobering than the promise of GST.",,,
225,,"Three years ago, the Centre and the States of the Union of India struck a grand bargain resulting in thelaunch of the unified Goods and Services Tax (GST) era. The States gave up their right to collect sales tax and sundry taxes, and the Centre gave up excise and services tax. The nationwide GST promised frictionless commerce across State borders,buoyant and leakproof tax compliance, and removal of inefficiencies like the cascade of tax on tax. This historic grand bargain was the result of painstaking consensus building, whichinter aliainvolved addressing the apprehension of States, of revenue loss due to the GST. Their consent was secured by a promise of reimbursing any shortfall in tax revenues for a period of five years. This reimbursement was to be funded by a special cess called the GST compensation cess. The promised reimbursement was to fill the gap for an assured 14% year on year tax growth for five years, and it was generous to a fault. Neither the national aggregate nor any of the major States had this record for the previous five years. But that was not the only fault with the design, which had also failed to learn from the successful design of harmonising Value Added Tax (VAT) rates across the nation, implemented just a decade ago. VAT was the precursor to GST and also needed a consensus. That design too had an inbuilt reimbursement formula. But that tapered over the years, making room for incentives for tax effort from the States, sort of skin in the game. As the economy battles a pandemic and recession, the tax collection has dropped significantly, while expenditure needs are sharply higher, especially at the frontline of the battle, at the State level. But it seems that the States have been told that they are on their own to meet the shortfall in revenues. Using an equivalent of the Force Majeure clause in commercial contracts, the Centre is abdicating its responsibility of making up for the shortfall in 14% growth in GST revenues to the states. This is wrong on many counts. First, the States do not have recourse to multiple options that the Centre has, such as issue of a sovereign bond (in dollars or rupees) or a loan against public sector unit shares from the Reserve Bank of India. Second, the Centre can anyway command much lower rates of borrowing from the markets as compared to the States. Third, in terms of aggregate public sector borrowing, it does not matter for the debt markets, nor the rating agencies, whether it is the States or the Centre that is increasing their indebtedness. Fourth, fighting this recession through increased fiscal stimulus is basically the job of macroeconomic stabilisation, which is the Centres domain. Fifth, and most importantly, breaking this important promise, using the alibi of the COVID-19 pandemic causes a serious dent in the trust built up between the Centre and States. Cooperative federalism is in the nature of a repeated game between the two entities, and every action must think of the future consequences, not just the immediate ones. Will it not weaken the foundation of trust?

Kautilya too would have advised the sovereign against reneging on the promised bailout, as fulfilling the obligation helps build trust with sub-sovereigns. The issue of GST compensation to the States is just the latest in the bumpy three-year journey of the new tax design. It is clear that the design needs a radical overhaul. Just tinkering with the compensation mechanism, or frequently changing rate slabs, or pushing more goods in the sin tax cess category, to earn revenue that is not shareable with the States, is not the way forward. What we instead need is a Grand Bargain 2.0 between the sovereign and the sub-sovereign entities.

What would this be based upon? We have to go back to first principles. GST is a destination-based consumption tax, which must include all goods and services with very few exceptions, such as food and medicine. That widening of the tax base itself will allow us to go back to the original recommendation of a standard rate of 12%, to be fixed for at least a five-year period. A comparison with Australia which also coincidentally shares its GST anniversary with India, is apt. For the past two decades their GST rate has been constant at 10%. Of course Indias single rate of 12% has to cover petrol, diesel, electricity, transport and real estate as well. Some extra elbow room for the States revenue autonomy is obtained by allowing the States non VATable surcharges on a small list of sin goods such as liquor, tobacco, polluting goods such as sport utility vehicles, and industrial fuels such as diesel, aviation turbine fuel and coal. A low moderate single rate of 12% encourages better compliance, reduces the need to do arbitrary classification and discretion, reduces litigation and will lead to buoyancy in collection.

Incidentally this redesign will scrupulously avoid the bogey of a revenue neutral rate (RNR) which needlessly occupied the attention of lawmakers and officials. GST is a long-term structural reform, while RNR is a short term and basically an elusive concept. In the long term there are many changes in consumption patterns, production configurations and locations, which cannot be anticipated and hence a static concept of RNR cannot be reference. The commitment to a low and stable rate,  la Australia and many other federal democracies, is a must. Of course the compensation-cum-reimbursement incentive can remain, but more in the nature of what was done for VAT harmonisation. his new grand bargain must recognise the increasing importance of the third tier of government. Even after 28 years of the 73rd and 74th Amendments, the local governments do not have the promised transfer of funds, functions and functionaries. These local bodies face increased responsibility of providing government services especially in view of increased urbanisation and decentralisation. Of the 12% GST, 10% should be equally shared between the States and the Centre, and 2% must be earmarked exclusively for the urban and rural local bodies, which ensures some basic revenue autonomy to them. The actual distribution across panchayats, districts and cities would be given by respective State Finance Commissions. GST consumption tax paid by every citizen establishes a tighter link between the governed and the government. The quality of governance improves as also, the tax base is better aligned with responsibilities of various tiers of government.",,,
