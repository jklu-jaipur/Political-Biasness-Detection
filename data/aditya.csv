130,,"MUMBAI: Energy minister Nitin Raut of the Congress said the opinion expressed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on the CAA and NPR appeared to be the views of the Shiv Sena.

""In my opinion, Thackeray has expressed his view in his capacity as the president of the Shiv Sena,"" Raut said.

Raut said the core committee of the Maha Vikas Aghadi would have to take a firm stand on the CAA and NPR.

""We are a three-party government comprising Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP. We are committed to implementing the common minimum programme. Sooner or later, the core committee will have to take a firm stand against the CAA and NPR. Both Congress and NCP, which are UPA partners at the national level, have made clear they are against CAA and NPR,"" he said.",,,
131,,"Former Minister and Congress leader Mohd. Ali Shabbir has strongly opposed Home Minister Md. Mahmood Ali's statement that Telangana Government would implement the National Population Register (NPR) in the new format.

Addressing a 'mushaira' held against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and NPR at Quli Qutub Shah Stadium here on on Monday night, he reiterated the allegation that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is a BJP ally and his government is ready to implement CAA, NRC and NPR in Telangana. He observed that the TRS opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament was only an attempt to mislead people, especially Muslims.

Similarly, the proposed resolution likely to be adopted in Assembly opposing the CAA would be another move to cheat people. ""What is preventing Mr. Rao from making an open statement that the State government would not implement CAA, NRC and NPR,"" he sought to know.

The Congress leader condemned Home Minister Mahmood Ali for his statement that NPR would be implemented in Telangana with six additional questions that require people to report the date and place of birth of their parents. He reminded that it was the Congress-led UPA government that had launched the population register in 2010 with 21 simple parameters and no community or individual had any objection to it.

However, the BJP government made it contentious by adding six new parameters which include Aadhaar number of the resident, voter ID, PAN, driving licence number and mobile phone and date and place of birth of parents and the last place of residence, Mr. Shabbir Ali stated. ""Before asking people, let Mr. Rao and Mr. Mahmood Ali tell the date of birth of their parents and furnish documents to prove it"", he suggested.

He stated that all Congress-ruled States had announced that they would not implement CAA, NRC and NPR and sought to why Mr. Rao is not doing so. He also slammed MIM leader Waris Pathan for his controversial ""15 crore versus 100 crore"" remark made a rally in Karnataka recently. He accused the MIM leaders of helping the BJP in the implementation of communal agenda in the country.

""With his controversial remarks, MIM leader had tried to sabotage the Shaheenbagh and other anti-CAA protests. People belonging to all religions and communities are taking part in the anti-CAA protests. But Mr. Pathan, at the instance of BJP and RSS, has tried to give a wrong impression that anti-CAA agitation belongs to only one particular community,"" the Congress leader observed.

Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy, Siasat Urdu daily Managing Editor Zaheeruddin Ali Khan, Youth Congress president M. Anil Kumar Yadav and other senior leaders participated in the protest mushaira.",,,
132,,"JAIPUR: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of destroying India's image as a country of peace and harmony and urged the youth not to let their voices be suppressed.

Rahul, who was addressing the 'Yuva Aakrosh' rally in the city, refrained from speaking directly against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act but lashed out at the Modi government for failing to generate employment for youth.

Coming down heavily on Modi government's promise of creating two crore new jobs every year, he claimed that one crore people had lost their jobs in the past year. ""Where are the 12 crore jobs of six years,"" he asked.

""Modi gives long speeches on CAA, NRC and NPR but prefers to remain silent on the issue of unemployment,"" he said, adding that ""the growth rate during UPA's tenure, which stood at 9 per cent, has fallen to below 5 per cent, according to the new parameters for calculating the GDP"".

""If we calculate it as per the earlier parameters, it will be around 2.5 per cent,"" the Congress leader said.

He urged the youth not to let their voice be suppressed and ask questions on employment and on the country's future.

Rahul Gandhi said that India was known as a country of peace and harmony, often cited as a contrast to Pakistan. But the image is now tarnished, and businessmen are wary of investing in the country, he claimed.",,,
133,,"In August 2017, I travelled to Kerala to shoot a special feature for Times Now on the series of political killings of RSS and Left workers, a bloody ongoing rivalry that dates back to the 1960s. The epicenter of this blood-feud is the district of Kannur, and a visit to the Communist Pary of India (Marxist) headquarters there provided a telling indication of the crisis of credibility that afflicts one of the self-proclaimed representatives of political liberalism in India. The four walls of the building's central hall are adorned with photographs of the party's 'martyrs' through the years, who've fallen at the hands of ideological and political rivals in a state where party or organizational affiliation worn as a badge of honour could also earn a place on an opponent's hit-list. But right above these photographs hung massive portraits of Communism's biggest icons, also some of the world's most ruthless tyrants. If Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong who murdered millions, eliminated rivals, and crushed dissent continue to inspire its cadres today, surely the moral high ground the Left likes to claim over a 'fascist-inspired Hindutva' propagated by the RSS and the BJP falls flat?

The ideological turf wars that the Left has waged against its opponents in Kerala and West Bengal, and the consequent retaliation, have claimed hundreds of lives through the decades. And yet, India's over-ground Communist parties are bracketed with the thoughts and ideas that social liberalism is meant to stand for: defending the right to free speech and expression, respect for religious and intellectual diversity, promoting inclusivity and accommodation, upholding one's fundamental rights and holding institutions accountable. But it's not just the Left that is undeserving of this association with liberalism. If the BJP, in the Opposition's eyes, is the anti-thesis of liberalism, the reality of India is that there's no other party worth its weight that can claim to truly represent itself as a liberal alternative.

One need not even go as far back as the Emergency or the anti-Sikh massacre to expose the Congress party's double-speak on liberalism. Several of the so-called 'urban naxals', such as Vernon Gonsalves and Sudhir Dhawale, whose arrests it now condemns as an act of muzzling dissent had brushes with the law and were jailed during the UPA tenure. The party's religious appeasement involved calls to fast-track terror cases where 'innocent' Muslims had been arrested, but it was the Maharashtra ATS reporting to a Congress-NCP government that jailed 10 Muslims for the 2006 Malegaon blasts. A decade later, they were acquitted with a large chunk of their life taken away from them, after the NIA under the UPA pursued a 'saffron-terror' angle, which too would wreck the lives of many Hindu under-trials before their cases fell flat.

Curbs on artistic creativity, bans on books, and imprisonment of cartoonists - remember Aseem Trivedi - are not a distant memory under the UPA rule. In fact, the UPA also stands guilty of not aggressively pushing for securing the rights of LGBTQIs as its reaction in 2009 when the Delhi High Court decriminalized homosexuality was guarded. It was only in 2013 when the Supreme Court overturned the 2009 verdict that the Congress' top brass including Rahul Gandhi spoke openly in favour of equal rights. And if that isn't enough, its opportunistic alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra represents anything but a commitment to the 'secular and liberal' values it claims to champion. It has clearly forgotten the 1992-93 Mumbai riots and the allegations it had leveled against the Shiv Sena over its participation, it has forgotten its own condemnations of the Sena's acts of vandalism, and its own accusations of its now-ally's 'fascist' leanings.

If that leaves Mamata Banerjee as a liberal alternative, one has to worry about the fate of liberalism in India. Her stature as a popular bulwark against the BJP in West Bengal has, among the BJP's critics, overshadowed the discourse around her own illiberal instincts, including jailing those who've caricatured her, and the violence of her party workers to preserve the hegemony the TMC currently enjoys in West Bengal. If the BJP's Hindutva assertion is a cause for alarm, Mamata Banerjee's desperation in ensuring the Muslim vote bank in West Bengal remains hers has been a recipe for polarization. And if one looks upon Mamata as a feminist for having fielded more women as candidates than her rivals, her party's confused response to triple talaaq, her silence on Sabarimala, or her callous reaction in 2012 to the Park Street rape are hardly assuring.

As for the AAP, many experts have speculated about their national viability after their triumph in Delhi. But Arvind Kejriwal's strategy of steering clear from commenting on 'national' issues, and preferring safety in silence than taking a position and drawing controversy clearly meant that he was shying away from an ideological fight.

But liberalism is alive, among the people and among certain institutions. The protests around the country against the CAA and the NRC cannot be simply dismissed as an overall expression of assertion by the Islamic fringe. Though it is undeniable that several radical Muslims have become involved, people from across faiths and across cities have participated in a movement that they believe is a necessary fight to protect the Indian Constitution. One can argue whether these fears are misplaced, but the BJP's climbdown on the NRC followed its own extremely bellicose campaign linking it with the CAA that only created uncertainty.

The prolonged lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir and the 'preventive' arrests of erstwhile allies of the ruling party have evoked considerable criticism, whatever one's views on Article 370. Civil society was very active in the legal campaign waged against Section 377, and the outrage against regressive practices such as triple talaaq was not confined to Muslim women. The apex court, by and large, has been receptive to this liberal impulse, be it in its decision to introspect on its own judgement on homosexuality and deliver a progressive verdict in 2018, decry the sexism and misogyny inherent in the erstwhile adultery law, and upholding India's identity as a secular state in its unanimous judgement in favour of Hindus in the Ayodhya case. While the Supreme Court's decision to re-examine its Sabarimala judgement allowing women between the ages of 10 to 50 entry into the temple has upset some liberals, its decision to deliberate on the matter under the larger rubric of women's rights together with discriminatory traditions in other religions may address the accusation of selectivity that both the court, and liberals, often invite.

But courts, fallible as they are, are an instrument of last resort, when faith in elected representatives has eroded. Unfortunately, that is the case in India. If India's liberals cringe about the BJP's free run to its communal rabble-rousers during election campaigns, or the branding of its critics as anti-nationals or part of a discredited 'Lutyens or Khan Market' cabal, there's virtually nothing they can celebrate about the Opposition. India's liberals know what they're opposing, and are making their voices heard, but there's no party they can really support.",,,
134,,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Thursday said the Nehru-Liaquat agreement of 1950 explicitly mentioned that citizenship would be religion-neutral as it accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of misleading the house to justify the controversial CAA.

Congress slammed Modi's speech in Lok Sabha as ""oscillating between stand-up comedy, half-truths and rank communalism"". AICC leader Rahul Gandhi accused the PM of distracting the country by talking about everything except youth unemployment.

After Modi quoted first premier Jawaharlal Nehru's pact with Pakistan and his communications with Assam's first chief minister to say that Nehru too wanted citizenship for minorities, AICC spokesman Manish Tewari slammed him for selectively quoting ""his illustrious predecessor"" and demanded that he apologise to the country. Congress said Modi had compromised national pride by mentioning Pakistan seven times in his speech and undoing the success of UPA regime in de-hyphenating India and Pakistan.",,,
135,,"All the regional parties have surrendered to the saffron party'

The Congress is the only party that can fight against the ruling BJP at the Centre, and to which all the regional parties, including the YSRCP, the TDP and the JSP, have surrendered, according to newly appointed APCC president S. Sailajanath.

Speaking at his swearing-in here on Wednesday, Mr. Sailajanath said all the regional parties were bowing before the Centre that was taking ""anti-people decisions.""

In such a scenario, it was only the Congress that could stand by the people and fight for them, he said.

Mr. Sailajanath dared Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to pass a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR) in the Assembly.

He asked the Congress activists and leaders to come out of their comfort zones and reach out to the masses.

Oommen Chandy, Congress party in-charge of Andhra Pradesh, said, ""The party's position in the State is not good, but we have good space here. Special Category Status (SCS) was assured by the UPA, but the BJP failed to accord it because it is against the State. The regional parties are weakened. The YSRCP government in the State has also become unpopular in a short time.""

""I request all the leaders who left the party in A.P. to return. We welcome them,"" he said, and asked the party rank and file to garner the support of people by taking to the streets and strengthen the party.

N. Tulasi Reddy and Sk. Mastan Vali were sworn-in as working president of the party in the State.

Senior leader and Rajya Sabha member K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao, Nalgonda MP and Telangana PCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy, former Union Ministers K.H. Muniyappa, M.M. Pallam Raju, and J.D. Seelam, Karnataka leader Dinesh Gundu Rao, All-India Mahila Congress president Susmitha Dev, AICC SC Cell chairman Koppula Raju, and TPCC leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka attended the programme.",,,
136,,"NEW DELHI: With the Budget session of Parliament due to begin later this week, Congress is readying a ""vigorous"" two-pronged attack on the Modi government over the controversial CAA-NRC-NPR as well as on the downward spiral of the economy.

Party sources said the session will see Congress corner the government over economic stress, increasing joblessness, plunging GDP and rising inflation on the one hand, while on the other, it will also continue its attack on the government over its ""communal and divisive"" agenda -- displayed though the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Congress will also hold a training session for its MPs, general secretaries and senior party functionaries on February 4, to explain to them the differences between the NPR proposed by BJP -- with the additional questions -- and the one that was mooted by the UPA government in its first term. Party sources said the leadership feels there is a need to have complete clarity among its members on what Congress is opposing in the new NPR and why it believes that the additional data is, in fact, being collected as a pre-cursor to NRC.

""After coming under attack over NRC, the government has now mooted NPR which is nothing but the first step to NRC. While the government is now trying to confuse people by claiming that the information sought under NPR is optional, we want to expose the government's real segregationist agenda behind the exercise,"" a Congress functionary said.

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram who was Union home minister when the idea of NPR was first mooted, will lead the training session to explain the differences between the old and new NPR to Congress functionaries. He will be aided in the exercise by his Rajya Sabha colleague Jairam Ramesh.",,,
137,,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday warned that street protests and arson against decisions of Parliament and state assemblies and people's refusal to accept laws will lead to anarchy, as he accused the Congress and other opposition parties of inciting protests against the CAA and the NPR.

Stoutly defending the Citizenship (Amendment) Act(CAA) and the updation of the National Population Register(NPR), Modi told Parliament there is an attempt to cover undemocratic activity under the garb of protests and that no one is going to get political benefit.

The prime minister accused the Opposition of using all its might to stoke ""imaginary"" fears about the CAA and the NPR which is worrisome and dangerous for the country.

""Don't try to mislead people"", Modi asserted, as he likened the Opposition's stand on the CAA to that of Pakistan, saying Islamabad spoke the same language for decades to mislead and incite Indian Muslims.

Modi tore into the Opposition in marathon combative speeches in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and said those rejected by people in elections are fuelling protests against the CAA and the NPR for their ""vote bank politics"". The fresh attack against the Opposition came two days ahead of the Assembly polls in Delhi which has witnessed protests in Shaheen Bagh, Jamia Millia and other areas.

Maintaining that the CAA does not affect any Indian citizen and poses no harm to minorities and that opposing NPR for political reasons will deprive the poor of benefits of welfare schemes, the prime minister said instead of scaring people right information needs to be provided and that there should be proper discussions. Questions asked in the NPR are purely governance related, he stressed.

The prime minister said Census and the NPR are ""usual administrative"" processes which have been carried out previously as well but have now suddenly become contentious.

Modi was replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address. The Motion was later adopted by the two Houses.

The prime minister delivered a stinging rebuttal to the Opposition over most issues its members raised to criticise his government and took on the charge that he pursued communal politics and wanted Hindu rashtra. He cited comments of Jawaharlal Nehru to back the law and said the Congress stalwart wanted citizenship for minorities from Pakistan.

Modi said Nehru had wanted to defend minorities in then West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

""Was he communal, did he want to create a Hindu Rashtra...I want to ask the Congress,"" the prime minister said.

Modi also touched on the issues of Kashmir, economy, unemployment and farmers distress while taking frequent digs at rivals, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi whom he dubbed a ""tubelight"". Describing Jammu and Kashmir as the ""crown jewel of India"", he said the identity of Kashmir was buried when the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits began in 1990.

Amid thumping of benches by ruling BJP members and their allies, the prime minister invoked the Constitution to warn against street protests to oppose decisions taken by Parliament and state assemblies.

The Congress was expected to be a responsible Opposition, but it had taken a wrong turn, he said.

Noting that the CAA was passed by Parliament and duly notified, he told opposition parties that the road taken by them raises worries, a reference to anti-CAA protests and support to them by many anti-BJP parties.

""What will happen if people refuse to accept a decision taken by the Rajasthan assembly, stage dharnas and resort to arson?' Modi asked and gave a similar example of Madhya Pradesh. The Congress is in power in the two states.

""What will then happen? Can the country run this way? This is road to anarchy... Such a way can put you (Opposition) in trouble as well. I am giving this warning as we all should be concerned about the country.""

""It is due to your work that people have sent you there,"" he said, referring to the opposition benches. ""Everybody has a right to put across their point of views but no good will come out of spreading lies and rumours. Respect the Constitution,"" he added.

People associated with the Congress and the Left have been inciting people, he said.

Dwelling at length on the NPR in the Rajya Sabha, Modi said it was being updated to allow the rightful beneficiaries get the benefit of government welfare schemes. The NPR was first done in 2010 and later updated in 2015, he added.

He said census and the NPR are ""usual administrative"" processes which have been carried out previously as well but have now suddenly become contentious.

Questions asked in the NPR are purely governance related, he said, citing the example of asking citizens of the language spoken by them and their parents are deeply linked to the schools that need to be set up in that particular area.

""They are opposing (NPR) for narrow and frivolous political narrative. This is anti-poor,"" he said, adding his government had made productive use of the data collected by previous NPR to give benefits of the schemes to the poor. He asked opposition parties to not politicise the issue for narrow political gains.

""We have record of your NPR, no citizen was persecuted based on that record of NPR,"" he said, citing the statement of the home minister of the Congress-led UPA government appealing to citizens to enrol in the exercise.

Hitting back at the Congress over its charge that his government violated the Constitution, Modi said it should be the party's mantra to speak 100 times a day about ""saving Constitution"" so that it remembers its sanctity.

Modi said India can no longer wait for problems to remain unsolved, and, rightfully so. ""That is why, our aim is speed and scale, determination and decisiveness, sensitivity and solutions"".

""The people of India have not only changed the Sarkar (government). They want the 'Sarokar' (conduct) to be changed as well. If we had worked according to the old ways and thought processes: Article 370 would never have been history. Muslim women would have kept suffering due to triple talaq,"" he said.

The prime minister said if his government worked as per the old ways, the Ram Janmabhoomi issue would have remained unsolved, Kartarpur Sahib corridor would not be a reality and there would be no India-Bangladesh land agreement.",,,
138,,"New Delhi: Referring to the anti-CAA protests in the city, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Monday said that people were still ""confused"" about the amendment made to the law and were creating an ""atmosphere of unrest"".

While urging protesters to practice restraint and maintain peace, Tiwari, who is a Member of Parliament from North East Delhi where violent clashes erupted on Sunday between those favouring and opposing CAA, said lakhs of people were being ""harassed"" due to the agitations.

""Under the guise of peaceful demonstration, miscreants are harassing millions of Delhiites by protesting on roads and committing violent activities. It is now important that they be controlled as soon as possible,"" Tiwari said.

Former Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken, however, urged chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to not appear ""helpless"" and take the ""lead"" in bringing the situation firmly in control.

In a series of tweets, Maken suggested setting up of a helpline to take complaints of violence or police inaction, calling an all-party meet to take suggestions from functionaries across party lines and formation of peace committees in troubled areas.

Maken, who was junior home minister in the UPA-II government between 2009-11, said he was making the suggestions to deal with Delhi riots on the basis of his experience in dealing with numerous administrative responsibilities.

In his tweets, Maken suggested: ""Establish a helpline directly under your office to receive complaints of violence or police inaction. This should be monitored and further passed on to police and the local SDM. Immediately call an all-party meeting, take suggestions and work across political parties to restore normalcy in troubled areas. Form peace committees with social influencers, including MLAs, councillors, district magistrate, local SHO and SDM. Make each minister of your cabinet in chargeof such committees and ask them to hit the ground.""

The senior Congress functionary also asked the chief minister to establish a hotline with the lieutenant governor and talk to him every hour to take stock of the situation. ""Take a lead and don't sit back blaming others. As a CM, please do not appear to be helpless. This would badly erode a much-needed credibility of our democratic institutions to protect atrocity/violence against innocent citizens,"" he added.

Senior BJP functionary and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel said he will start a campaign against Shaheen Bagh protests on March 1 from Delhi University's Bonta Park. He added he will visit parks across the city every morning to talk about Shaheen Bagh.

""Women at Shaheen Bagh are being exploited as shields by Opposition parties. This is a very well-thought conspiracy to instigate riots,"" the MP claimed.",,,
139,,"JAIPUR: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused PM Modi of destroying India's image and scaring away investors, and urged the youth to not let their voice be suppressed.

Addressing the 'Yuva Aakrosh' rally in Jaipur, Rahul, however, refrained from speaking directly against CAA, but lashed out at the Modi government for failing to generate jobs for the youth. Coming down heavily on the Modi government's promise of creating 2 crore jobs every year, he claimed that 1-crore people had lost their jobs the past year alone. ""Where are the 12 crore jobs of six years,"" he asked.

""Modi gives long speeches on CAA, NRC and NPR but prefers to remain silent on unemployment,"" he said. ""The growth rate during UPA's tenure stood at 9%, which has now fallen to below 5%, according to the new parameters for calculating GDP (gross domestic product). If we calculate it as per the earlier parameters, it will be around 2.5%,"" he added.

Urging the youth not to let their voices be suppressed, the former Congress chief encouraged them to ask questions on employment and the country's future. Rahul said India was known as a country of peace and harmony, often cited as a contrast to Pakistan. But the image is now tarnished and businessmen are wary of investing, he claimed.

""PM Modi has destroyed India's reputation in the world. Today, India is known as the rape capital, but Modi does not talk about this,"" he said.. When the youth raise questions over unemployment and ask Modi why he ""destroyed"" India's image, they ""are answered with bullets and are suppressed"", Rahul remarked.

140,,"In his Lok Sabha address, the Prime Minister spoke on the issues of Kashmir, economy, unemployment, farmers distress and also took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi, whom he dubbed a ""tubelight"".

Accusing the Opposition of inciting protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday warned that street agitations against decisions of Parliament and State Assemblies may lead to ""anarchy"" and that everyone should be worried over it.

Strongly defending the CAA that has triggered protests, PM Modi reiterated in Lok Sabha that it does not affect any Indian citizen and poses no harm to minorities, and said those rejected by people in elections are fuelling protests against it for their ""vote bank politics"".

He accused the Opposition of using all its might to stoke ""imaginary"" fears about the law, which grants citizenship to minorities from three Muslim countries in the neighbourhood, and likened its stand to that of Pakistan, saying Islamabad spoke the same language for decades to mislead and incite Indian Muslims.

Pakistan could not succeed, and what has surprised him that those thrown out of power by voters have resorted to doing such things, Mr. Modi said in his over 100-minute-long reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address, which was later passed by Lok Sabha.

So much criticism of the CAA has been made ironically by those who love getting photographed with the group of people who want ""tukde tukde"" of India, he said, adding that even courts have asserted that protests should not inconvenience people and be not marked by violence.

""We have seen the kind of speeches and remarks were made recently (in these protests). Big leaders of Opposition go there. I regret it,"" he said.

BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, have often hit out at these protests, including the one in Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, saying anti-India and radical speeches have been made.

The Prime Minister delivered rebuttal to the Opposition over most issues its members raised to criticise his government and took on the charge that he pursued communal politics and wanted Hindu rashtra. He cited comments of Jawaharlal Nehru to back the law and said the Congress stalwart wanted citizenship for minorities from Pakistan.

What will happen if people refuse to accept a decision taken by the Rajasthan Assembly, stage dharnas and resort to arson, Mr. Modi said and gave a similar example of Madhya Pradesh.

The Congress is in power in the two States.

""What will then happen? Can the country run this way? This is road to anarchy... Such a way can put you (Opposition) in trouble as well. I am giving this warning as we all should be concerned about the country,"" the Prime Minister said.

""It is due to your work that people have sent you there,"" he said, referring to the Opposition benches. ""Everybody has a right to put across their point of views but no good will come out of spreading lies and rumours. Respect the Constitution,"" he added.

He hit back at the Congress over its charge that his government violated the Constitution. PM Modi said it should be the Party's mantra to speak frequently about ""saving Constitution"" so that it remembers its sanctity.

The Congress government imposed the Emergency, curbed judiciary's powers, spoke against people's right to life and dismissed Opposition-run State governments frequently, he said. ""We believe in the Constitution,"" he added.

He also dubbed the National Advisory Council, a body set up during the UPA era to advise the Manmohan Singh government and headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, as a ""remote control"" that enjoyed a ""bigger role"" than the Prime Minister.

Questioning if such a body was constitutional, Mr. Modi also recalled as to how Rahul Gandhi had torn a bill passed by the UPA government to attack the Congress.

Mr. Modi recited a verse to take a swipe at Opposition parties for their backing to anti-CAA protests and referred to their leaders making speeches there.

People associated with the Congress and the Left have been inciting people, he said.

Quoting Nehru, Mr. Modi said India's first Prime Minister in a letter to the then Assam Chief Minister in 1950 had asked him to distinguish between Hindu refugees and Muslim migrants from Pakistan and said the law should be amended to grant citizenship to the refugees if required.

""This was not only Mahatma Gandhi's but also Nehru's sentiments. Was Pandit Nehru communal? Did he discriminate between Hindus and Muslims? Did he want Hindu rashtra?"" Mr. Modi asked, asserting that several reports, including those of Parliamentary panels, had recommended a law such as the CAA.

He said the Congress is having problems when his government is taking decisions to fulfil wishes of the country's ""founding fathers"".

The Opposition has frequently accused the Modi government of pursuing communal politics, discriminating against Muslims and seeking to make India a Hindu rashtra.

The country would not have seen the real face of the Opposition if it had not made so much of noise against the law, he said.

Taking a swipe at Opposition members for invoking contributions of Muslims to India's freedom struggle, he said they look at them as Muslims but they are Indians to his party.

The Prime Minister said that he in his youth had touched the feet of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and named other greats such as Ashfaqullah Khan, Begum Hazrat Mahal and A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to assert that they were all Indians.

Describing Kashmir as ""crown jewel"" of India, he said his government has pushed development measures in Jammu and Kashmir and asserted that it had faith in the people of Valley.

Mr. Modi cited comments of Kashmir leaders Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, who had warned that any decision to nullify Article 370 may sever the Valley's link with India, to ask if those who believe in India's Constitution can tolerate these remarks.

Mr. Modi said Kashmir's identity was buried on January 19, 1990, when Kashmiri Pandits started leaving the Valley due to militancy.

Elaborating on his government's achievements, the Prime Minister said the people of the country have seen his government's work between 2014 and 2019 and gave a bigger mandate in 2019.

PM Modi said India can no longer wait for problems to remain unsolved, and, rightfully so. ""That is why, our aim is speed and scale, determination and decisiveness, sensitivity and solutions"".

Without naming Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Modi said, ""I heard an Opposition MP saying 'we will beat Modi with sticks in 6 months' I have also decided I will do more 'Surya Namaskar'.

This will make my back even stronger to face abuses. In any case, I have been abused so much for the last two decades that their negativity hardly matters.""

Referring to the Northeast, PM Modi said, ""The Bodo Accord signed now is special because it has brought all stakeholders together and we are moving towards a more peaceful era. It has ushered in a new dawn.""",,,
141,,"The government has stated in Parliament that it hasn't taken any decision yet on preparing a National Register of Indian Citizens, but this may not be enough to bridge the political trust deficit. A shelving of the nationwide NRC project, or at least declaring a five-year moratorium pending the generation of greater consensus around it, would have worked better. Given the radical nature of the exercise - in effect, requiring all Indian citizens to prove their citizenship all over again, to the satisfaction of petty bureaucracy - the extent of mistrust it has generated was to be expected. That mistrust is only reinforced by the Assam chapter of NRC being acknowledged to be a failure by all sides including BJP.

Some states where opposition parties are in office are now unwilling to proceed with the National Population Register updation, and many others betray uneasiness over the exercise. This is a pity as NPR, which could have been used to strengthen welfare measures, is now falling victim to the CAA-NRC controversy. Unlike UPA which did not pursue NRC after the first NPR exercise in 2010, the NDA government has become a victim of BJP's powerful hyper-nationalist messaging that jumped the gun by promising a nationwide NRC to follow the controversial CAA it legislated. The Citizenship Rules, 2003, envisage NPR as the staging point for a local and national register of citizens. So it was but natural for critics to link NPR, for which funds were sanctioned in December 2019, to the nationwide NRC that top BJP leaders were promising for several months.

It would be useful here to fall back on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's original call for 'minimum government, maximum governance', and refocus on the economy that is in dire need of attention. With NRC out of the way, the government will be in a position to recreate optimism around India's economic prospects.",,,
142,,"NEW DELHI: From sprucing up the sprawling ground to extensive traffic and security arrangements, workers and authorities were busy making final preparations at the historic Ramlila Maidan here for the swearing-in ceremony of Arvind Kejriwal as chief minister of Delhi for the third successive time on Sunday.

Preparations underway at Ramlila Maidan.

Big banners bearing messages like 'Dhanyawad Dilli' along with the image of the AAP supremo were put up on Saturday in and around the venue ahead of the mega function which is ""open to public"".

With AAP scripting its third consecutive win in the Delhi assembly elections, excitement is palpable among party workers and senior leaders alike, all of whom are expecting a huge crowd at the event.

Around 50 people from different walks of life who are responsible for 'Delhi nirman' will share stage with Kejriwal during his swearing-in ceremony, AAP leader Manish Sisodia said.

He said these people would include teachers, bus marshalls, architects of the Signature Bridge and families of fire fighters who lost their lives.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the ceremony, besides BJP MPs and MLAs from Delhi. The AAP had said no chief minister or political leader from other states will be part of the event as it will be a ""Delhi-specific"" ceremony.

On the eve of swearing-in ceremony, Kejriwal called a dinner meeting of his ministers-designate to discuss the roadmap for Delhi's development, especially the initiatives that need to be prioritised in the coming three months, according to party functionaries.

All the six ministers in the previous government -- Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gehlot, Imran Hussain and Rajendra Gautam -- have been retained.

Workers were on Saturday giving a fresh paint job to the white ceremonial platform at the Ramlila Maidan, and the area around it was being decked up with potted plants and flowers.

A large contingent of security personnel was given briefing by Delhi Police authorities at the Maidan.

Officials said 2,000 to 3,000 security personnel from the Delhi Police and paramilitary forces, including the CRPF, were being deployed for the ceremony which is scheduled to begin at 10 am. Drones were likely to be used for aerial surveillance.

Traffic regulations will be in place in the area from 8 am to 2 pm, they said.

Senior AAP leader Gopal Rai said as this is an event open for public.

""We are expecting a good number of people to turn up tomorrow,"" he said.

""Baby Mufflerman'' Aavyan Tomar, who stole the hearts when he dressed up as the AAP convenor on counting day, is a 'special invitee' at the ceremony.

The AAP supremo had on Thursday extended invitation to Delhiites to attend his oath-taking ceremony to ""bless their son"". Advertisements were also issued in leading dailies.

""Delhiites, your son is going to take oath of Delhi chief minister for the third time. You must come to bless your son. Sunday, February 16, 10 am, Ramlila Maidan,"" Kejriwal had tweeted in Hindi.

Rai had earlier said that all seven Delhi MPs and the eight newly-elected BJP MLAs have been invited for the oath-taking ceremony.

In a near-repeat performance of 2015, the Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party, which was floated in November 2012, retained power with a scintillating win in the just-concluded Delhi assembly polls, trouncing its main rival BJP and completely decimating the Congress in a keenly-watched battle that took place in the midst of anti-CAA protests.

As the AAP bagged 62 out of the 70 seats, leaders cutting across party lines, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi (Congress), Sharad Pawar (NCP), Mamata Banerjee (TMC), Naveen Patnaik (BJD) and MK Stalin (DMK) had congratulated Kejriwal for the victory.

For the 51-year-old bureaucrat-turned-politician who will assume the post of Delhi chief minister for the third time, the Ramlila Maidan holds special significance as it had served as his battleground during the Anna Hazare-led India Against Corruption movement.

The Delhi government, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which owns the Maidan, and public works department are working in tandem to make the venue ready for the occasion.

""We had levelled the ground during the PM's event that took place recently. So, other ground work is being done. The PWD is making necessary arrangements too,"" a senior NDMC official said.

Toilet blocks are in place in and around the Maidan. Arrangements for other sanitation facilities like mobile toilets, are being done, he said.

The ground, where socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan had addressed a massive gathering during the 'Total Revolution' movement in 1970s, has a capacity of about 1.25 lakh people.

Sources said that besides seating arrangements, there will be space for people to stand.

In 2015 too, Kejriwal's oath-taking ceremony had taken place at Ramlila Maidan. It was held on February 14, coinciding with the Valentine's Day.

In 2013 after his party's first poll victory, the swearing-in ceremony was held at the same venue. Over a lakh people had attended the event on December 29 that year.

The AAP had in 2015 stunned its opponents with a massive win in the assembly polls, clinching 67 seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly.

Kejriwal repeated his triumph in the high-profile New Delhi constituency, defeating Bharatiya Janata Party's Sunil Kumar Yadav by a margin of 21,697 votes.",,,
143,,"NEW DELHI: With Delhi assembly elections just days away, the controversial remarks by BJP leaders Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma during the poll campaign and the ongoing anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh figured prominently in Lok Sabha on Monday.

The lower house witnessed protests by opposition members, mostly from the Congress and the DMK, against the amended Citizenship Act, with Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury saying the government cannot silence people's ""boli"" (voice) with ""goli"" (bullet).

Speaker Om Birla and parliamentary affairs minister, Pralhad Joshi asked protesting members, who had trooped into the Well as soon as the Question Hour began at 11am, to raise their issues during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.

With opposition members carrying placards and raising slogans against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Speaker adjourned the House after a little over 10 minutes following the Question Hour. He emphasised that it was for lunch.

People are protesting to protect the Constitution and are carrying national flags, Chowdhury said, alleging that some protesters were killed ""mercilessly"".

""You are fake Hindus,"" he said, attacking the BJP, and added that if its members were ""asli (genuine) Hindus"", then they would have behaved differently.

Thakur, who is the minister of state for finance and corporate affairs, had made some controversial remarks during a recent poll rally in the national capital.

He was banned from campaigning by the Election Commission for three days for egging on people to raise the slogan ""shoot the traitors"", after he lashed out at anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protesters.

Belligerent Congress members, who were in the Well, shouted slogans against the minister and asked ""Aapka goli kaha hai? (where is your bullet?)"".

Some members also shouted ""Goli maarna band karo (Stop shooting)"".

Whenever Thakur was responding to supplementaries during the Question Hour, the members began sloganeering against him.

Opposition members, including those from the Congress and the DMK, also walked out of Lok Sabha to protest the controversial remarks by BJP member Parvesh Verma during a poll rally, when he rose to initiate a debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address .

As soon as Verma rose to initiate the debate, opposition members raised slogans against him like ""sharm karo (have shame)"".

Speaker Om Birla said what a member says outside cannot be raised inside the House and that members should not set a ""wrong precedent"".

Verma was barred by the Election Commission last week for four days for his controversial remarks made during an interview and at an election meeting.

Verma took on the Congress for its opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act, saying, ""They should know that it is not Rajiv Feroze Khan government, it is Narendra Modi's government.

""We will not take back CAA. It is a question of the country's integrity.""

He referred to the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, saying it is not a protest against Citizenship Amendment Act, rather people there are saying ""Pakistan zindabad, and Assam and Kashmir should be separated from India.""

Verma said India is proud to have such a President who has rejected the mercy plea of Nirbhaya convicts.

Congress' Gaurav Gogoi demanded that Thakur be booked under relevant laws.

He alleged that political masters at the top are giving directions to ministers to make inflammatory speeches.

""Book the minister"" under relevant laws, he said without taking any name.

""In front of Delhi police, a boy fired on the people,"" the Congress leader said adding ""he must have been motivated by someone"".

""I want to know who is pulling the trigger. It's not the minister or that boy,"" he added.

PK Kunhalikuty (IUML) said that in the Delhi election rallies while the AAP and the Congress are talking about development, the BJP is trying to make it as ""communal as possible"".

""They are even giving a call to shoot people. People sitting in high offices are making these calls,"" he alleged, adding they are targeting a minority community in the country.

He said that no senior BJP leader is condemning such remarks.

""The Prime Minister talks about new India but it is full of hatred, anarchy and joblessness,"" he alleged.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to reply to the debate on Wednesday.",,,
144,,"NEW DELHI: No one in the BJP is worthy of becoming chief minister of Delhi, AAP supremo and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday, the last day of campaigning before the February 8 assembly elections.

People want to know who will be the Bharatiya Janata Party's chief ministerial candidate, Kejriwal told PTI in an interview, and asked what if the party chooses Sambit Patra or Anurag Thakur for the post.

He said the Bharatiya Janata Party had tried to polarise the assembly polls, and asserted that results will show if it succeeded or not.

""AAP voters are those who want good education, medical treatment, modern roads, 24-hour electricity,"" Kejriwal said.

Discussing the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh, the AAP national convener alleged that the BJP has not cleared the Shaheen Bagh road because of the assembly elections.

""What stopped Union home minister Amit Shah from clearing the stretch. What is Amit Shah's interest in keeping the road blocked? Why do they want to trouble the people of Delhi and do dirty politics over the protests?"" Kejriwal asked.

Continuing his attack on the BJP, he added that the saffron party's leaders have ""completely forgotten"" the city's unauthorised colonies and are misleading the people.

""Delhi government's 'free schemes' will continue if AAP voted back to power, we will introduce more schemes if needed,"" said Kejriwal.",,,
145,,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra claimed on Wednesday that the juvenile who shot at and injured a student at an anti-CAA protest gathering near the Jamia Millia Islamia University last week was a voter of the Jewar assembly constituency in Uttar Pradesh.

At a press conference, Chopra also cited the voter identity card number of the accused and sought a probe into the matter by a government agency.

The accused fired at a group of anti-CAA protesters near Jamia Millia, injuring a student, on January 31. Police caught him and sent him to protective custody.

""This person voted in the last Lok Sabha election. His name is registered as a voter in the electoral roll of Jewar assembly constituency,"" Chopra said, citing the accused's voter photo identity card number.

""If it is true, which forces are trying to protect him? Terming him a juvenile, he is being let off. This should be probed by a government agency,"" he said.

The Congress leader also slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), accusing them of trying to ""polarise"" the February 8 Delhi assembly polls.

""They are bent on spoiling the peace before the polls,"" he alleged.

Chopra also demanded a probe into the firing near the Shaheen Bagh protest site by Kapil Baisala on February 1, who the police claimed was associated with the AAP.

He appealed to people to maintain peace and said if anything happened to the women protesters at Shaheen Bagh, no one would forgive the BJP and the AAP.

Chopra also demanded Union home minister Amit Shah's resignation and ""sacking"" of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the shooting incidents near anti-CAA protest sites in the national capital.",,,
146,,"NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 61.46 per cent voter turnout on Saturday, down from 67.47 per cent in 2015 assembly election, with exit polls predicting an easy win for AAP, which sought to retain power on development plank, against the BJP that ran an aggressive campaign centred around the issues of anti-CAA protests and nationalism.

The polling went off peacefully, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh told reporters.

Over 60,000 security personnel, including Quick Response Teams, had been deployed for the election while police and paramilitary forces conducted flag marches in sensitive areas.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

The voting percentage was 57.04 till 6 pm deadline, and rose to 61.46 per cent as those in queues at polling stations were allowed to vote, poll officials said, adding it may increase further.

The officials said Mustafabad (66.29 per cent), Matia Mahal (65.62 per cent) and Seelampur (64.92 per cent) -- all three with large Muslim population -- recorded the highest voting percentage till 5 pm.

Long queues were seen outside polling stations in areas like Jaffrabad, Jamia Nagar, Turkman Gate and Shaheen Bagh which have been witnessing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

In the 11 districts in the national capital, northeast recorded 65.24 per cent turn out, northwest (62.23 per cent), south (59.65 per cent), central (58.57 per cent), southwest 61.57 (per cent), east (61.29 per cent), west (61.79 per cent), north (57.19 per cent), New Delhi (56.10 per cent), Shahadra (62.96 per cent) and southeast (54.89 per cent).

On a sit-in for over a month against the Citizenship Amendment Act, women protesters at Shaheen Bagh in south-east Delhi voted in batches ""so that the agitation remains unaffected"".

Mehzabeen Qureshi, who returned to the protest site after voting, said, ""I stayed at home to let other women in the house go out and vote. Now I have joined them here at Shaheen Bagh after voting. I voted today to secure democracy"".

Polling started at a sluggish pace and the voting percentage was low till noon. However, it picked up pace as the day grew warmer.

A senior Delhi poll official said the lower turnout compared to 67.47 per cent in the 2015 Assembly polls could be attributed to the polling day falling on a weekend as a section of people may have gone out of the city. The voting percentage was 60.6 in 2019 Lok Sabha election.

A poll officer died apparently due to a heart condition at a polling booth at Babarpur, just before the voting began, Singh said.

Congress' Chandni Chowk candidate Alka Lamba got into an altercation with an AAP worker outside a polling booth and tried to slap the man, but missed.

Lamba alleged that the man used ""very foul"" and objectional language against her.

Free electricity and water, development, jobs, national security and CAA were among the key issues on the minds of Delhiites in the polls where 672 candidates were in the fray in 70 Assembly seats.

Sonakshi Ranjan (22), a first-time voter, said she opted for development while casting her vote. S C Sharma (74), a voter in Kalkaji constituency, said he voted for development and national security.

Exit polls have predicted a clean sweep for the ruling Aam Aadmi Party while the BJP was a distant second.

Most exit polls also predicted that Congress is unlikely to open its account even this time in Delhi, which it ruled from 1998-2013.

After the polls ended, BJP President J P Nadda held a meeting with party's Delhi unit leaders and took stock of the situation. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari put up a brave face amid prediction of defeat for his party, claiming it will win 48 seats and form a government in the city.

AAP leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said his party is going to win with a big margin.

There were some complaints related to VVPAT slips. Congress' New Delhi candidate Romesh Sabharwal said VVAPT slips did not show his name and photo.

""I gave a written complaint to poll authorities after which the machine was replaced,"" Sabharwal said, adding that polling was halted for sometime.

Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh said that Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) failure was only one per cent this time.

""There was very little VVPAT failure this time. In the Lok Sabha election, the VVPAT failure was more than 12.5 per cent and this time it is less than 1 per cent,"" he said.

""Because of our enforcement and preventive action we took, the elections went off peacefully,"" Singh told reporters.

Police said over 200 calls related to election complaints were received at the Delhi Police's control room on the polling day.

First time voters and women turned out in large numbers. More than 60 centenarians voted in the assembly polls, Singh said.

President Ram Nath Kovind, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma and Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari also exercised their franchise. Union Ministers S Jaishankar and Hardeep Singh Puri were also among those who cast their votes.

Chief Minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal voted at Rajpur Transport Authority polling station in the Civil Lines area.

Kejriwal, who is contesting the polls from the New Delhi constituency, was accompanied by his wife Sunita and son Pulkit. Before leaving for voting, he sought his parents' blessings.

Former vice president Hamid Ansari and senior RSS functionary Ram Lal were among those who queued up outside the Nirman Bhavan polling station in the first hour of voting.

Minutes before polling began, Kejriwal tweeted, ""Please go to cast vote. A special appeal to all the women - as you shoulder the responsibility at home, likewise, the responsibility of the country and Delhi is on your shoulders.""

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who covered 60 assembly seats during his whirlwind campaign, appealed to voters to ""free"" the national capital from lies and vote-bank politics.

""By giving Delhi clean air, clean drinking water and every poor house, only the best capital of the world can make it a government with far-sighted thinking and strong intentions.

""I appeal to the people of Delhi to vote to free Delhi from lies and vote bank politics,"" Shah tweeted.

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's son Rehan and Kejriwal's son Pulkit were among first-time voters.

Asked if his father will be the CM again, Pulkit said whoever people choose will become the chief minister of Delhi.

Talking to reporters, Rehan said that public transport should be more affordable for students.

Taking a swipe at those protesting against CAA-NRC, senior RSS functionary Ram Lal said those shouting ""kagaz nahin dikhayenge"" would be defeated in the Delhi assembly election as he appealed to people to show documents while voting.

He asked voters to keep in mind who can make Delhi the best capital city in the world.

Hundreds of people, protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in many areas across the country, often raise the slogan of ""kagaz nahi dikhayenge"" (we will not show show documents).

""My message to the voters is 'aaj apna kagaz jaroor lekar jayen. Kagaz jaroor dikhayen' (Today, take your document along with you and show your document),"" Lal said.",,,
147,,"NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday questioned the timing and motive behind the recent revelation by Delhi Police in connection with the shooting incident at anti-CAA protest site in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh.

Responding to the Delhi Police's crime branch's revelations that Kapil Gujjar, the man who had opened fire in Shaheen Bagh on February 1, was an AAP member, the ruling party in Delhi blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for playing ""dirty politics"" in the run-up to the assembly polls in the national capital.

Addressing a press conference, AAP leader Sanjay Singh questioned how the probe details reached Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari even before they were released by the police.

""At whose behest the Delhi Police is making a statement? How did the investigation detail reach BJP leaders even before the news came out. Manoj Tiwari made a statement this morning that the accused is from the AAP. How did the Delhi BJP chief come to know about it in advance?"" asked AAP leader Sanjay Singh while reacting to Kapil Gujjar being called an AAP man by the cops.

""Amit Shah is the home minister of the country right now. And before the elections, many more photos and conspiracies will be found. There are just three to four days left for the elections. BJP will do as much dirty politics as they can. What does having a picture with someone means?"" Singh asked ANI.

""Conduct investigations in the crime and take action against the accused. Do not try to disillusion the people of Delhi. The matter is not related to a photo, but of a crime and we have been demanding strict action against the accused from day one,"" he added.

Terming the announcement made by Delhi Police a violation of the Model Code of Conduct, Singh said his party would lodge a complaint with the election commission.

""Investigation has not been completed, photos have not been investigated and a police officer is taking a party's name, at a time when the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is in place. Tomorrow, we will complain to Election Commission (EC) against Rajesh Deo,"" said Sanjay Singh.",,,
148,,"Flickr....flickr....flick. PM Modi has just called Rahul Gandhi a tubelight. Yes, before the 2019 general elections, Rahul could have been rightly accused of being a tubelight. Even though he shed the pappu tag with victories in MP, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh, the flick after flickr....flickr didn't arrive.

PM Modi was there for the taking in 2019, but Rahul completely lost the plot with Rafale and whatnot. He took defeat heavily, going into hibernation as he often does after a big defeat. He grew a stubble, put on weight, and started looking like a combination of what his father, Rajiv, and his grandfather, Feroze, would have looked at his age.

He has let his ailing mother stabilize the Congress. He has let his sister Priyanka, with whom time seems to have been kinder than to him, steal the political limelight. He allowed the staunchly secular Congress align with the rabidly communal Shiv Sena to steal power in India's greatest state, Maharashtra. Yes, the tiger (Balasaheb Thackeray) got along well with the lioness (Indira Gandhi), but even they must be rubbing their eyes in disbelief at the coming together of their progeny.

The three-wheeler is chugging along well in Mumbai, under the sagacious leadership of Uddhav Thackeray, his brilliant son Aaditya, the oil being put by Sharad Pawar to grease the axis of evil according to Devendra Fadnavis (the Sena, the NCP, the Congress), whose wife Amruta it seems will have to wait until spring 2025 and not spring 2020 as when she had forecast her husband's return to power, and with Rahul stopping his people in Maharashtra from mouthing off about secularism, CAA and all the other three letter acronyms that you can think of.

Remember, three letter acronyms are never dirty words, it's always the four letter ones that are. But suddenly in India, the three letter ones, 370, CAA, NCR, NPR, etc. appear to have taken a life of their own.

Rahul still is the principal challenger to PM Modi. His mother, Sonia, feels that her poor boy has suffered enough and must take the Congress's helm once again. But has the flick returned to Rahul's flickr...flickr.

Suddenly, India has a crop of leaders to challenge PM Modi in 2024 for the prime minister's role. There's Rahul, there's Didi, there's Uddhav, there's KCR, there's Kejriwal. There are all united in their intense desire to keep the BJP out of power.

The crucial Delhi elections are nigh. AAP, the BJP, and the Congress are locked in a three-way contest. But AAP and the Congress seem to be pulling punches with each other. It seems that if the BJP doesn't get an outright majority, and if neither of the other parties does, then AAP and the Congress could team up to keep the BJP out of power. It could be Maharashtra all over again. How many states will the BJP keep losing from its grasp? Its hold on India seems to be shrinking spring by Amruta's spring.

The founders framed a wise Constitution dividing powers between the centre and the states, which no one in his right mind has disputed in 70 years. Yes, BJP, you have got the centre, but do you have the periphery? The BJP is looking more and more like the Mughals of circa 1800, who were called the kings of Delhi and no more.

Defeat in 2019 seems to have taught Rahul a valuable lesson. For a politician, power is never poison, the non-pursuit or the lacklustre pursuit of power often is. The Congress and like-minded parties like the Trinamool, the TRS, the AAP, the NCP, the PDP (once again all these three-letter acronyms but never dirty as I promised earlier) are gheraoing the BJP and even parties that don't see eye to eye with the Congress such as the Sena and the AIMIM, a party lead by the erudite Asaduddin Owaisi who can often look unreasonable as when he disparages the RSS chief's Mohan Bhagwat's sage idea of a two-child policy for India.

All three Gandhis-Sonia, Rahul, and Priyanka-have taken their gloves off in attacking PM Modi now, whereas between 2014-19 they seemed somewhat intimidated by him and his meteoric rise to power. Priyanka is doing much of the talking today. Rahul knows its Priyanka that the BJP is mortally afraid of, so he's letting her be her natural self. He seems to have realized that his own natural role is to be the back-room strategist. Has Rahul finally stopped being a tubelight? Has he gone from being flickr....flickr....flick to just being straight-up flick. Team up with the Sena. Flick. Hand over the stage to Priyanka. Flick. Team up with AAP? Flick.

Really, is Rahul a tubelight no more? India's electoral destiny and most importantly, Decision 2024, rests on the answer to this question.",,,

The Minister of State for Social Justice also alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is in power in Delhi, was involved in the riots. He also accused the Congress of provoking Muslims to protest against the CAA.

""The Congress has been provoking people for several days. It is wrong to mislead Muslims over the CAA. It has to be probed whether the Congress and AAP has a hand in the Delhi violence,"" he said.

""The CAA is meant to provide citizenship to the oppressed people from neighbouring countries and not to take away the citizenship of Indians,"" the Minister added.

Polling will begin at 8am and will end at 6pm on Saturday.

While specific election duties have been given to Delhi Police personnel, the CAPF companies have been deployed to provide security at polling booths and movement of EVMs.

Around 19,000 Home Guards from states like Uttarakhand, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh will also assist the local police in providing security at polling booths, the officials said.

A multi-layered security has been put in place at 21 counting centres and 2,689 polling premises, out of which 545 are ""critical"", they said.

""Delhi Police personnel and para military forces have been deployed at critical booths so that more enforcement and better arrangement can be ensured. Patrolling has also been intensified in those localities,"" said Sharat Kumar Singha, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Election Cell).

Marked by the BJP aggressively pushing the anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh as a poll issue, the AAP hard selling development and the Congress conspicuous by its near absence, the bitter, often divisive campaign for the Delhi assembly elections ended on Thursday.

Additional forces have also been deployed to bolster the security of EVMs, critical booths and counting centres, he said.

Static surveillance teams and flying squads have been deployed and special checking drives are being conducted in vulnerable areas to check any attempt to influence voters by money or muscle power and other unlawful practices, police said.

""EVM transportation drill has been planned in coordination with polling officials. All necessary measures have also been taken, including from the anti-terror angle in vulnerable areas. Senior officers will closely supervise arrangements at the ground level.

""Thorough area domination will be ensured in sensitive and vulnerable areas, and all precautions will be taken to ensure smooth movement of voters to the booths,"" a senor police official said.

Pickets on borders have been strengthened to check transportation of illicit liquor and other contraband. All border areas will be kept under strict vigil by regularly coordinating with counterparts of NCR police, he said.

Also, patrolling on boats in the Yamuna river is being done, he added.

According to police, since the enforcement of Model Code of Conduct, 99,210 litres of illicit liquor, with a market value of Rs 2.72 crore and 774.1 kg drugs with a market value of Rs 4.91 crore have already been seized as part of the special drives.

So far, 504 illegal fire-arms and 730 ammunition have been recovered. Besides, 7,397 licensed weapons have also been deposited as a preventive measure, police said.

Action has been taken against 7,820 people under the Excise Act.

While 5,943 persons have been booked under various sections of CRPC, 1,26,095 persons have been booked under DP Act. Besides, 529 cases have been registered under Defacement Act so far, according to the police.

Police have also issued a public appeal to report and share objectionable messages and other social media messages which violate the poll code.

The counting of votes will be taken on February 11.",,,
151,,"Many Muslim voters said though they were ""anxious"" over some objectionable statements made by the saffon party leaders, they rejected politics over religion.

Voters in Muslim-dominated constituencies of Delhi said they voted on Saturday over the issues of jobs, development, education, health care and civic amenities. Of all constituencies where the community's population can sway the poll results, three witnessed a healthy turnout.

In the run-up to the February 8 polls, there were allegations of religious polarisation with the BJP making the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh its poll plank. Many Muslim voters said though they were ""anxious"" over some objectionable statements made by the saffon party leaders, they rejected politics over religion.

At the close of polling, the top three assembly segments in terms of voter turnout were Mustafabad, Matia Mahal and Seelampur, as per provisional turnout figures provided by the election commission. All these seats have a large Muslim population.

""More than casting a vote in favour of someone, this election is about casting a vote against someone. Against those who believe in politics of religion over politics of work, employment and development,"" said Sarfaraz Khan, a resident of Seelampur, a constituency that witnessed violence in December, days after the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed in Parliament.

As many as five out of 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi have about 50% Muslim population, suggested data shared by political parties. Several residents of these colonies said that they voted for good education, good healthcare and civic amenities such as water, sewer and better roads even as they expressed anxiety over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the idea of a pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Iqbal Ahmed, an embroidery worker in Ballimaran, said he would not vote for ""Hindu-Muslim politics"". ""The most important thing for a common man is development. We want our state government to provide us basic facilities such as electricity, water, education and clean roads and not one that divides people on religious lines,"" he said.

Araish Fateema, a resident of Matia Mahal, said: ""Our choice is clear. We have voted for the party who can provide better future to our children. My daughter studies in a government school and I am very happy with her progress. We don't need leaders who know only about politics on religious lines.""

Praveen Rai, political analyst with the Centre for Study of Developing Societies, said: ""The BJP polemics against anti-CAA protesters at Shaheen Bagh and other places have led to a strong consolidation of Muslim votes against it. They seem to have voted en bloc for AAP in this election. The exit polls predicting a clean sweep for AAP confirms their voting choices.""

In the 2015 polls, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won the Matia Mahal and Seelampur constituencies with margins exceeding 25,000 votes in each. The party, in its second poll outing in the year, also went on to win the Ballimaran and Okhla seats with huge mandates - around 60% and 62.5% vote shares, respectively. However, this year, these two constituencies witnessed very low turnout.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had won the Mustafabad seat with a 35% vote share, benefiting from a split of Muslim votes between AAP and the Congress - they bagged around 32% and 30% votes, respectively, from the constituency. The BJP's Jagdish Pradhan, a Gujjar, is the first non-Muslim MLA since the assembly segment was carved in 2008.

In few Muslim-dominated constituencies, voters anticipated a split in Muslim votes between two parties but found themselves in a fix when asked if they could see a third party could benefit from the potential split.

""It does not seem like the numbers could add up and lead to an unexpected result. The winning candidate is likely to be a Muslim,"" said Mohammad Usman, a resident of Jafarabad in Seelampur.

While both AAP and the Congress have fielded Muslim candidates in the constituency, the BJP's choice is a Hindu face - a strategy the saffron party has followed in all Muslim-dominated constituencies across the city.

However, in neighbouring Mustafabad constituency, Samiuddin Haider did not seem confident about the outcome. He said, ""A split can lead to unexpected results and we have seen that happen last year.""

Most Muslim constituencies in Delhi have some common trends - old-school political leaders with large personal following is one such. In several of them, the parties have fielded political heavyweights - Mateen Ahmed and Parvez Hashmi for the Congress in Seelampur and Okhla, respectively. The AAP's choice for Matia Mahal, Shoaib Iqbal, has been MLA for five terms for three different parties since 1993.

Such factors make calculations difficult in many such Muslim-dominated constituencies, several residents said.",,,
152,,"NEW DELHI: In the end, the 2020 Delhi assembly polls turned out to be Landslide 2.0 in favour of Aam Aadmi Party. And social scientists believe that the victory of Arvind Kejriwal will momentarily stem BJP's raucous political rhetoric.

""The election result is good news for Aam Aadmi Party, people of Delhi and India. If the BJP had succeeded, then this vitriolic campaign of communal hatred would have become a standard template. We are saved from that. The victory has also put some brake on the BJP steamroller which is out to dismantle the republic,"" says social scientist Yogendra Yadav, also a former member of AAP's apex Political Affairs Committee,

Rahul Verma of Centre for Policy Research said that there is now a template emerging to challenge BJP. ""But the good news for BJP-Modi is that the template suggests that the parties have to be on the Centre-Right. None is taking them on over the question of religion and nationalism. In that sense, it is their ideological victory. It moves the fulcrum of ideological contest to Centre-Right,"" he said.

""The voters are also making a distinction between state and center. But how long and far needs to be seen. We have seen that since 2018, a segment of voters who support Modi and BJP during Lok Sabha elections chose opposition parties during state elections. This is an emerging trend, but we don't fully understand the reasons behind it. BJP is facing a difficult time to hold on to states. They need to introspect on strategy to retain or win states,"" Verma said.

Political scientist Imtiaz Ahmad said it would be too early to say if Delhi represents a trend towards decline of Hindutva politics. ""However, it is certain that things may not go smoothly for BJP in Bihar and West Bengal. Modi has opened too many fronts: Kashmir, CAA, NCR, and much would depend on what happens on these fronts. The ST and SC issue too will heat up soon. If Muslims, Dalits and Sikhs come together Hindutva politics may run into difficulty,"" Ahmad said.

A former member of AAP's apex Political Affairs Committee, Yadav said that AAP fought a difficult election coming back from a complete reversal in the Lok Sabha polls and managed a remarkable comeback in the face of a very aggressive BJP campaign and a docile EC. At the same time, it would be wrong to see this as a new model of governance or a new type of politics.

Yadav, now president, Swaraj India party, said that the performance of the AAP government was ""moderate"" with ""focus on some visible delivery, without paying much attention to the rest"".

But he also pointed out that ""the formula has been used previously by Naveen Patnaik in Odisha, Nitish Kumar in Bihar, Modi when he was Gujarat CM and Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh. AAP also had a very powerful communication machine, a fairly-organised electoral machine and rode on a personality cult. Instead of changing the rules of the game, the new entrant has learnt the existing rules better than the older players.""

Verma said that AAP smartly steered clear from the ideological planks of the BJP and kept the campaign very local. ""BJP did not have a state-level leadership to match Kejriwal's personality and charisma. And Kejriwal, for his own good, avoided a direct 'personality' contest with PM Modi,"" he said.

""AAP could now be in a good position to make a comeback in Punjab, which is due for polls in 2022. If they manage to do so, they can emerge as an important pole at the national level,"" he said.

Ahmad said that BJP neither had ""a leader with a strong base in Delhi"" nor any blueprint for the capital. ""It chose instead to try to polarise through focussing on Hindu-Muslim issue. The language used by the BJP leaders put off people, especially Muslims and moderate Hindus. On the contrary, AAP focused throughout on a development agenda. Its performance over the past five years, particularly water, electricity and mohalla clinics had made a good impact on people. In a nutshell AAP performance helped it greatly.""

Congress received a mere 4.2% of the votes. In 2015, it had earned 9.7 of the votes. In 2013, Congress had got 24.6% votes. Many reasons have been attributed to the party's precipitous slide.

Yadav said he did not attribute the fall in Congress votes to the party's electoral strategy or campaign. ""The Congress didn't have much to present to the people: a leader, a plan, a manifesto or a strategy. It is the Delhi voters' who decided that in Lok Sabha, it is BJP vs Cong and in the assembly polls, BJP vs AAP,"" he said.",,,
153,,"The heated Delhi assembly election campaign and protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act have combined to create a restive air in the country's capital. BJP, desperate to wrest Delhi from the Aam Aadmi Party has run a provocative campaign labelling its opponents as anti-nationals. While home minister Amit Shah is leading a typical hardline campaign by foregrounding the CAA, nationalism and AAP's ambivalence towards the Shaheen Bagh protests, others like UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union minister of state Anurag Thakur and local MP Parvesh Sahib Verma have exceeded limits and made hate speeches.

As if on cue from such speeches, the area around Shaheen Bagh, where protests have now crossed 50 days, has seen three shootings in four days. Delhi Police's inept handling -- cutting a sorry figure during the first shooting incident by an alleged juvenile -- appears to have emboldened more fringe elements. The police, already facing flak for failing to stop the attack on teachers and students in JNU or take penal action afterwards, cannot afford to let the situation slide any further.

To prevent a more serious situation from developing heads have to roll but Delhi top cop Amulya Patnaik, who has had a forgettable stint, has been granted an extension. Elections are a time for people to assess the work done by their government over the past five years. Political violence, especially during elections, is dangerous because it sows the seeds of fear in voters, undermines democracy and distracts from real issues. BJP didn't really try to sharpen its attack on AAP's developmental claims after making initial efforts. Time will tell whether this was a mistake or not.

Addressing an anti-CAA protest in Karnataka , Owaisi said: ""Firqa Parasti (fascism) in the country has increased to such an extent that if an election has to be won, let it be Congress or AAP or BJP, they try to prove who is the bigger Hindu. While BJP takes Ram's name, AAP takes Hanuman's name and a Congress leader claims he is Shiv bhakt.""

Criticising Congress leader Rahul Gandhi without naming him, Owaisi said, ""The Congress leader will become 50 years old soon, but he is still youth. If he is youth, I am forever young. Only my beard is white, but my heart is young. This Congress leader claims himself to be a Shiv bhakt.""

The Hyderabad MP recalled Godhra massacre case. He said that people who killed innocents have been granted bail, and an innocent school principal has been jailed on sedition charges. Owaisi was referring to the bail granted to convicts in Sardarpur riot case of 2002 (post-Godhra), and a school principal in Bidar being booked under sedition charges in January after students staged a anti-CAA play at the school.",,,
155,,"NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) campaign for the February 8 assembly polls has turned vitriolic with West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma warning people in the Capital that those gathering at southeast Delhi's Shaheen Bagh for the anti-CAA protest will ""enter your houses, rape sisters and daughters and kill them"".

In an interview to a news agency, he added that the protesters would be cleared in an hour if the BJP comes to office in Delhi.

The statement followed controversies in which junior finance minister Anurag Thakur and BJP's Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra find themselves embroiled.

BJP's campaign makes Shaheen Bagh focal point, links it with security threat

With just 10 days to go for the assembly polls, these statements by BJP functionaries are being seen as an attempt to polarise voters. The Shaheen Bagh protest is now being referred to by every party functionary addressing public meetings or press conferences in Delhi.

A large number of women have been protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act -- which promises citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh -- demanding a rollback. An arterial road, which connects Noida with south Delhi, is now blocked due to the protest, causing a lot of hardship to commuters.

Verma alleged that attempts were being made to spread ' jihaad' in all parts of the city. ""Lakhs of people gather there (Shaheen Bagh)...They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. There's time today (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji and Amit Shah won't come to save you tomorrow,"" Verma told the news agency.

Speaking at an election rally a day before, he had emphasised that if BJP comes to office on February 11, the protesters would be cleared within an hour and all mosques built on government land would be razed. Defending his statement, Verma later told Times Now that the protesters were being supported by the AAP government and they will immediately vacate the stretch once the saffron party assumes office. He also drew a parallel between the Shaheen Bagh protest and the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Verma said he feared that a similar ""fire"" may soon spread in the capital.

Earlier, Union home minister Amit Shah, who kicked off the party's poll campaign with a public meeting in southwest Delhi's Matiala on January 23, connected the protest with the security of Delhi, alleging that it was being supported by AAP in Delhi. On Monday, his cabinet colleague, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said the protest was a ""textbook case of a few hundred people trying to suppress the silent majority"". He also claimed that the protest was against Prime Minister Modi and those who were trying to ""fragment"" India were getting cover there.

A senior party functionary confirmed that BJP's poll campaign in the next few days will revolve around ""nationalism"" and turn more ""hardline"". He said CAA, Ram Temple and abrogation of Article 370 will feature in all election rallies with special focus on Shaheen Bagh.

Days earlier, Kapil Mishra had drawn a parallel between the Delhi assembly polls and India-Pakistan contest. ""Pakistan is entering through Shaheen Bagh, and mini-Pakistans are being created in Delhi...Shaheen Bagh, Chand Bagh, Inderlok,"" he had tweeted in Hindi but later deleted it following a rap from the Election Commission.

Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, Mishra alleged that Shaheen Bagh was a ""creation"" of AAP and Congress. ""When BJP reacted to it, it backfired on them. BJP ran a massive campaign on local Delhi issues -- pollution, contaminated water, poor public transport -- but it was forced to react to it. Public sentiment on this issue was very high and people were really angry about it (Shaheen Bagh protest),"" he said, adding that this election was being fought on a 20% (Muslim) vote bank and 80% (Hindu majority). ""AAP and Congress were doing politics of 20% vote bank and taking 80% population for granted,"" he added.

Echoing the sentiments of his party colleagues, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari alleged that a section of people was trying to create hatred and disturb harmony ahead of the polls. ""Slogans are being raised at Shaheen Bagh that Modi and Shah will be killed and they want ' Jinnah wali azaadi'. This is dangerous,"" Tiwari said. ""Keeping Delhi secure is important and that is why this has become an election issue.""",,,
156,,"NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has scored a hatrick in the Delhi assembly election and is all set to form the government for the third consecutive term in the national capital.

AAP breached the high octane campaign launched by BJP that was led by home minister Amit Shah who raked up national issues and the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act, making it a ""Shaheen Bagh versus all"" contest.

Kejriwal, in contrast, confined his campaign to the achievements of the AAP government in the last five years. He made the BJP's frontal attack on him as Delhi voters versus BJP.

Finally, AAP emerged victorious, almost repeating its 2015 performance. These are the seven reasons behind Kejriwal's victory:

Check on private school fee

The Arvind Kejriwal government's decisions in the education sector have perhaps played the most important role in AAP's victory.

With many families in the national capital having school-going children, the Kejriwal government's moves touched their lives in one way or the other.

In a major public-friendly decision, the AAP government did not allow the 200-odd private unaided schools to arbitrarily hike fees in the last five years.

The schools even moved the Delhi high court against the government's decision. The single judge quashed the government's circular in March last year. The government challenged the order. In a major relief to the parents, the division bench put a stay on the interim fee hike.

While campaigning for the Delhi assembly election, Kejriwal on January 19 said his government would continue to check the school fee like they did in the last five years.

In a tweet posted in Hindi, he said, ""As long as there is an honest government in Delhi, the parents need not to worry about school fees. No private school in Delhi will be allowed to hike fees arbitrarily. Like the last five years, we will continue to check the fees.""

The Kejriwal government even forced schools to roll back fees and return the excess amount to the parents if it found irregularities in fee hike.

Upgrading government schools

The AAP govt in Delhi brought unprecedented changes in government schools - right from infrastructure to teachers' training to paying more attention to interaction with parents. No wonder Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the portfolio of education minister, have major claims to make.

Kejriwal said, ""We have ensured that our government schools are at least as good if not better than the private schools. About 25 per cent of Delhi's annual budget has been invested in education in the past three-and-a-half years... The budget for the sector is three times more than what it was when we came to power. With these funds, our schools today have world class infrastructure with SMART classes, swimming pools, classroom libraries, modern desks and better laboratories.""

Kejriwal also claimed that several parents had shifted their children from private schools to the government schools. The teachers and school leaders were given opportunities to learn from some of the most prestigious universities across the world, including University of Cambridge, University of Harvard and NIE Singapore, among others.

Sisodia, meanwhile said Delhi's government schools had outperformed private schools in the CBSE 12 standard examinations.

In its manifesto, AAP claims to have added 20,000 new classrooms in over 200 government schools in Delhi. All previous governments in the national capital had managed to build 17,000 classrooms in all these years.

An interesting aspect of the education reforms is the strict implementation of PTM (parents-teacher meeting). Earlier, PTM was only on paper. However, the Kejriwal government implemented it in 2016, giving a sense of pride and satisfaction to the parents who for the first time started getting feedback on their children's development from teachers.

Free electricity and water

The AAP government gave subsidised electricity to Delhi residents six months ago. On August 1 last year, Kejriwal announced 100 per cent subsidy to those who consume up to 200 units of electricity. Consumers of 201-400 units of electricity started receiving approximately 50 per cent subsidy.

""People used to pay Rs 622 for 200 units of electricity till yesterday, now it's free. For 250 units they used to pay Rs 800, now they'll pay Rs 252. For 300 units, they used to pay Rs 971, now they'll pay Rs 526. For 400 units, they used to pay Rs 1320, now they'll pay Rs 1075,"" he added.

AAP also fulfilled its promise of supplying free water upto 20,000 litres per household per month. In December 2017, the Delhi Jal Board hiked water charges for families consuming more than 20,000 liters of water per month. These families pay Rs 28 per litre extra every month or 85 paise per day. However, for families consuming 20,000 litres, water was kept free of cost.

Mohalla clinics

To offer cheap and quality health facilities to the people, the Kejriwal government had promised to put in place a network of 1,000 mohalla clinics under the neighbourhood health facility scheme. However, it could open only 301 such clinics.

The clinics offer free basic medical care services for common illnesses like fever, diarrhoea, skin problems, respiratory problems, first aid for injuries and burns, dressing of minor wounds and referral services.

While dispensing free medicines and check-ups, it also allows 212 tests by the empanelled laboratories.

Mohalla clinics earned praise globally. World leaders such as former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and former WHO director general Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland hailed the project.

Free DTC bus ride

The Kejriwal government extended free rides in Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses from October 29 - more than three months before the assembly election. The bus conductors distribute Rs 10 pink tickets to each woman passenger, which allows them to travel for free.

Soft Hindutva

Besides these innovative experiments and subsidies, the Kejriwal government also peddled soft Hindutva in order to wean away a chunk of BJP's voters.

Just a day before voting for the 2015 Delhi assembly election, Jama Masjid Iman Syed Ahmed Bukhari appealed to Muslims to vote for AAP. However, Kejriwal's party declined the offer saying it was against any type of caste and communal politics.

However, Kejriwal haas tried to woo people on religious lines.For instance, he has been regularly seen attending iftar events and sporting a skull cap.

Further, on July 12, Arvind Kejriwal flagged off the first train under the Mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra (Chief Minister's Pilgrimage) scheme. Under the scheme, trains ferry senior citizens to five different routes of religious significance for free. The government bears the entire expenditure, including travel, accommodation, meals and miscellaneous arrangements.

The scheme covers five routes - Delhi-Mathura-Vrindavan-Agra-Fatehpur Sikri-Delhi, Delhi-Haridwar-Rishikesh-Neelkanth-Delhi, Delhi-Ajmer-Pushkar-Delhi, Delhi-Amritsar-Bagha Border-Anandpur Sahib-Delhi and Delhi-Vaishno Devi-Jammu-Delhi.

Besides this, Arvind Kejriwal presented himself as a devotee of Lord Hanuman just a few days before the February 8 assembly election. He sang the Hanuman Chalisa and said it gives him peace of mind.

A day before voting, Kejriwal visited Hanuman Temple in Delhi along with his family members and offered prayers. On the voting day, he was seen sporting a tilak on his forehead.

Kejriwal has also never extended explicit support to the Shaheen Bagh protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Image makeover

Arvind Kejriwal launched a major image makeover in the last couple of years.

Earlier, he was in constant confrontation mode with the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over one issue or another, especially full statehood to Delhi.

He even called Modi ""psychopath and coward"" and had expressed apprehension that Modi and Shah would get him killed.

He strongly opposed the Centre's actions such as demonetisation. He had also demanded proof of the Indian Army's surgical strikes in Pak-occupied Kashmir.

For about three years, Arvind Kejriwal kept complaining that Modi was not allowing him to work.

However, over the last few months, Kejriwal changed tack. The aggression against Modi and Shah became a matter of the past.

Unlike his strong response to issues such as demonetisation and surgical strikes, Kejriwal did not take a strong stand against CAA and NPR. He did not openly support the Shaheen Bagh protesters, neither did he visit the protest site.

Kejriwal also sought to strike an emotional chord with the voters when BJP MP Parvesh Verma called him a terrorist. He narrated how his parents were hurt by that allegation and asked voters to decide if he was their eldest son or a terrorist.

He also sought to garner sympathy by discussing his health problems, saying he takes insulin four times a day as he suffers from acute diabetes. However, he undertook 15 days' hunger strike twice for the country.",,,
157,,"After an eventful first term political startup AAP is seeking votes again on the basis of its governance record, while BJP is going all out to unseat it. Until about mid-2017 AAP and BJP constantly baited each other, as a consequence of which governance had suffered since the structure of authority in the national capital is a divided one. Since then chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appears to have kept his head down, toned down the theatrics and focussed on administration - perhaps out of a realisation that voters will tire of the constant search for enemies and demand results.

It's to his credit that he sees his government's primary job as delivering on education and health - areas that have been traditionally under-emphasised by India's political class. BJP, however, has had plenty of opportunity to dissect Kejriwal's claims and question his purported successes on these and other governance related areas, and it's a little surprising that the principal opposition party hasn't made full use of that opportunity. Rather than Kejriwal's performance BJP has bet big on making the elections a mandate on Shaheen Bagh, even if painting AAP and Shaheen Bagh protesters with the same brush is a bit of a stretch. This has occurred in the midst of hate fuelled shootings, campus violence and gross incompetence in policing.

Kejriwal has kept his distance from the protests and placed the onus for resolution on the Centre, with its control over police and traffic. By supporting Article 370 nullification, opposing CAA, and focussing on work done by his government, AAP has staked out a middle ground in the last couple of years. BJP's campaign, by contrast, places a premium on national security in a local election. This is a novel plank, and it's anybody's guess how Delhi's electorate responds in an assembly election to issues not of local roads, hospitals or plumbing, but of an abstract nationalism that consists of taking on spectral enemies who occasionally morph into the figures of opposition parties and leaders, if not Shaheen Bagh protesters.

BJP's strategy has, for instance, resulted in attempts to characterise Kejriwal as a ""terrorist"". Some have seen in the strategy a way of energising its core cadre while getting out the Hindu vote. If this strategy succeeds, it will have ramifications for future elections as well. We will know by next Tuesday, when results are declared.",,,
158,,"In the first state elections of the new decade, whose outcome will be known on Tuesday, incumbent chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in the face of a strong challenge mounted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

After being witness to a fierce election campaign, nearly 14.79 million registered voters in Delhi will finally get an opportunity to vote on Saturday to choose representatives to 70 assembly segments across the national capital and decide who governs the city-state for the next five years.

In the first state elections of the new decade, whose outcome will be known on Tuesday, incumbent chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in the face of a strong challenge mounted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has sought votes in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The first is the AAP's attempt to replicate its success of the 2015 assembly election -- when it won 67 of the 70 seats -- versus the BJP's effort to replicate its success in the 2019 Lok Sabha election,when it won all seven parliamentary seats in Delhi. The second is the AAP's campaign, which is focused on local governance issues and its track record in the past five years versus the BJP's, which focused on the larger ideological issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, national security, and an effort to project all protesters -- and the AAP -- as ""anti-national"". The third is an effort by the AAP to carve out a multi-religious and multi-class alliance versus the BJP's campaign to consolidate Hindu voters across regions, castes and classes. And the fourth is the question of leadership -- where the CM is not pitted against a local rival but the PM.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said the primary issue in the election will be the work done by his government, but hit out at the rival BJP for trying to change the discourse and make it ""about a Hindu vs Muslim"" issue. ""Ours is the first government in 70 years that is seeking votes entirely on the ground of work done on the development front,"" he told HT in an interview on Wednesday. People have to decide whether they ""opt for the politics of abuse and violence, or politics of development"", he added.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said his party's agenda was development. ""We are talking about Ayushman Bharat for free medical care and PM Awas Yojana to provide housing to people... Non-implementation of these two schemes will be the main reason for AAP's defeat in Delhi,"" Tiwari told HT on Wednesday, adding that party did not endorse the provocative statements of some of its MPs.

Over the last four years, the city has voted distinctly for distinct elections.

During the 2015 elections, the AAP bagged 54% of the vote share in the polls. But its vote share decreased in the next two elections held in the city -- the municipal elections in 2017 and the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. The AAP polled the highest share of votes in 2015; it stood second in the 2017 civic elections, with 26% of the votes, and finished third in five of the seven seats in the 2019 national elections, dropping to 18% of the votes and winning no seat.

On the contrary, both the BJP and the Congress improved in terms of vote share in this period. The BJP polled 56% votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, up from 36% in 2017 and 32% in 2015. In 2019, it had a lead in 65 of the 70 assembly constituencies. The Congress got just 10% of votes in 2015, 21% in 2017 and 23% in 2019.

Political observers believe that this election will significantly depend on whether voting patterns of the Lok Sabha election hold, or whether it reverts to the assembly pattern. A Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)-Lokniti poll conducted during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls showed that only about half of the people who voted for the BJP or the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls would have voted for the same party in case of a snap assembly election. The corresponding figure was 82% for the AAP.

The second variable is the impact of the campaign on the polls.

The AAP -- through government advertisements before the model code of conduct, public interaction programmes, townhall meetings by Kejriwal, hundreds of small corner meetings in Delhi neighbourhoods, dozens of rallies and roadshows, and a strong social media campaign -- has advertised its governance record.

In particular, it has focused on the improvement in government schools, public health systems, provision of electricity and water supply and subsidised rates, and free public transport for women. It has also promised to focus on pollution, provision of clean water and cleanliness in its next term if elected to power.

At the end of last year, the BJP had two key campaign planks. Through a parliamentary legislation, and then an announcement by PM Modi at a rally in Delhi, the party claimed credit for providing ownership documents to four million residents of unauthorised colonies in Delhi.

It also promised ""triple-engine governance"" under Modi, for the BJP would then hold the reins of power at the central, state and local level if elected to power.

But the party's campaign took a turn in the wake of protests against the CAA, particularly in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh area. Led by home minister Amit Shah, the party deployed its Cabinet ministers, MPs, former and current chief ministers, and the cadre of ideological affiliates of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to project the protests as ""anti-national"" in character and which suited Pakistan. It blamed the AAP and the Congress for backing these protests, spreading anarchy and violence, and causing inconvenience to the city's residents.

Commenting on the nature of the campaign, Shakti Sinha,a former bureaucrat who has served in the Delhi government and former director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, said: ""AAP's subsidy policy has huge long-term development costs in terms of forgone investment in infrastructure and sustainability, but has created a huge constituency of beneficiaries. Will the BJP be able to sell its message of nationalism and empowerment? It has stemmed the tide that was flowing against it but would it be enough to bring it to power?""

The third related strand was mobilisation of different segments. The AAP hopes to win the substantial support of the city's Muslim population -- which is influential in close to 10 seats. While the minorities had shifted in large numbers to the Congress in the Lok Sabha election, reports indicate they may consolidate behind AAP for they see it as the party best positioned to defeat the BJP. The AAP also hopes to win the support of the Hindu poor and the lower middle-class, primarily on the ground of having delivered tangible benefits to these segments through its welfare schemes. AAP has also sought to quell the impression, pushed by BJP, that it is against Hindu interests, with Kejriwal reciting the Hanuman Chalisa, going to the Hanuman temple on Friday, and candidates repeatedly emphasising their religious identity -- besides focusing on how the party has promised lessons in patriotism in school curricula and supporting moves such as the nullification of Article 370 that gave Jammu and Kashmir special status.

The BJP, for its part, is hoping to consolidate Hindus -- across different demographic segments, from Punjabis, Banias, Purvanchalis (migrants from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar), and Dalits. This is based on the premise that the largely Muslim-driven protests against CAA would antagonise the majority community.

It is here that the performance of the Congress will also play a role, for if it retains its base of Muslims and the poor, weaning them away from AAP, especially in constituencies where it has put up locally strong candidates, it may benefit the BJP.

""Ultimately, it may boil to how much vote the Congress attracts; the higher it is, the more AAP would suffer,"" Sinha said.

And the final strand is leadership. While AAP's mascot is Kejriwal, the BJP is primarily focusing on Modi as the face of the campaign. While the PM addressed only two rallies, it is his image that adorns the party's hoardings and advertisements. Just as in 2019, when the BJP asked who the opposition had to counter Modi, Kejriwal in 2020 is asking who the BJP has to counter him as the CM.

""Arvind Kejriwal is the pole along which these elections are being fought. The AAP is fighting on Kejriwal's charisma and his governance,"" said Neelanjan Sircar, who is affiliated with Ashoka University and the Centre for Policy Research. ""The BJP has ceded the governance narrative to the AAP, but is trying to paint Kejriwal as inimical to Hindu interests. And the Congress is a shadow of its former self.""

It remains to be seen if the BJP had polarised the electorate enough to pull off a win in Delhi, he added. ""Otherwise, it's advantage AAP.""",,,
159,,"Buried in countless discussions on the failure of hate campaign against Shaheen Bagh and the victory of the Aam Aadmi Party's politics of ""kaam"" has been the actual role of the women of Shaheen Bagh. The Union Home Minister's exhortation to deliver ""electric current"" to Shaheen Bagh, the chanting of ""goli maro"" and the actual attacks by stray shooters, crafting sedition charges against individuals, have contrasted singularly with the pictures of rows of women sitting with children, waving the flag and copies of the Constitution and most of all, dedicated to peaceful protest. The importance of this cannot be underestimated.

Speaking at a panel on the results of the Delhi elections on a television channel, Seshadri Chari, a senior BJP spokesperson, described the communally vituperative campaign of his party as ""not hate politics but strategy"". This is a chilling statement. The problem, however, is not only its questionable morality - an important if not scary issue - but the failure of the strategy.

Clearly, as strategy, it has had its uses. The BJP vote share in the 2020 Delhi elections has been reasonable enough. But it failed to produce a cutting edge precisely because the strategy did not extend beyond the rhetoric of incitement. It was the deliberate commitment to peaceful protest by the women satyagrahis - ordinary mothers, homemakers, youth - that staved off any violent counter-response. Counterfactually speaking, if there had been the slightest hint of violent response, the spiral of violence and communal polarisation would have been uncontrollable. The strategy of hate would then have been unstoppable. It would have upended the politics of ""kaam"".

It may be recalled that the women have carried on despite no acts of solidarity from AAP; instead, they have continuously faced the fear of violent ejection by the police. It is the silent contribution of the Shaheen Bagh women that remains unremarked upon in the high-decibel commentaries on the election results.

It raises a difficult question for the BJP now. It deliberately nationalised the elections. Beginning with the Prime Minister, organised and co-ordinated by the Home Minister and deploying a phalanx of Chief Ministers and over 200 MPs, the BJP campaign has been one of the most communal vituperative ever in the history of India's elections. It has raised questions of national integrity, portraying Shaheen Bagh as a centre of terrorist and anti-national activity - and then going on to associate this unpleasing fiction with AAP. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself has been accused of being a terrorist. The basic elements of this campaign are by no means new. Over time, any opposition to the BJP has been progressively labelled as anti-national. This has provided a momentum of aggression to BJP's nationwide campaigns.

For BJP, Shaheeh Bagh was the testing ground of a new use of communal mobilisation. Within less than a year of its massive general election victory and the apparent success of its strategy of dismembering the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP government has faced the strongest-ever protest that has spread across the entire country on the issue of the CAA-NRC. Most importantly these protests were carried out by the youth of different communities, becoming a platform for voicing dissatisfaction against a governance perceived to be high-handed, regulative of lifestyles and unable to provide jobs.

The Delhi elections provided an opportunity to begin a counter-initiative by the BJP. The BJP-ruled States had put down the protests with an iron hand.

Shaheen Bagh provided an opportunity to initiate an ideological counter-offensive against the protests. Indissociable from the protests against the CAA-NRC which it had given birth to, Shaheen Bagh could be deployed to isolate, marginalise and communalise the protests. The only problem - which finally defeated the BJP strategy - was that it was dominated by women who refused to be provoked.

The unresponsiveness of these women was complemented by the careful distancing of the AAP from the protesters. Both of these put BJP out on a limb. More importantly, it allowed the focus to be put on a positive element, that is, the work done by AAP. If Shaheen Bagh dominated the saffron air waves, it was kaam that was discussed among the ordinary voters on the ground. The laying out of water and sewage pipes, free bus rides to women, the rise of standards in government schools and so on, dominated the agenda. It became so effective that the ground campaigners of the BJP had to take recourse to questioning the wisdom of providing ""freebies"" to the electorate. In short, BJP workers were caught in the self-defeating position of saying that the electorate was unfit for the welfare measures that they have traditionally expected the state to provide.

Where does the BJP go from here? Can it afford to charge with all the vituperation and aggression at its command, like Don Quixote against windmills that refuse to move? For BJP aggressive polarisation has been important for both electoral victory while combining this with establishing the affective and ideological foundations of a future Hindu Rashtra. But if communal polarisation does not work as an issue, what else will the BJP have in its electoral kitty? Delhi has shown that a purely negative campaign of discrediting the agenda of its rivals will not do. Nor can it step back now, for the reputation of its Shah-Modi leadership has been built on its authoritarian stubbornness to defend its positions. There is too much now at stake for the BJP leadership and too little ammunition at its disposal.",,,

Poet-politician Kumar Vishvas nudged Union Home Ministry and the Delhi Police after reports emerged that stacks of petrol bombs and chemicals were found at the house of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Tahir Hussain, who has been accused by locals of instigating the violence in Northeast Delhi on Sunday.

""Hey Yudhishthir, you don't get the videos of inflammatory speeches, but can't you see the petrol bombs stacked at this leader's house? An IB official was dragged into the house and killed and the media is showing the evidence, where are you? Give us the answer,"" Vishvas said on Twitter in Hindi. He attached a news clip of a report from Hussain's house and also tagged the Home Ministry in his tweet.

Twenty-six-year-old Intelligence Bureau (IB) official Ankit Sharma's body was found in Chand Bagh in Northeast Delhi - one of the worst affected areas during violence - in a drain. Sharma's family members have accused Hussain of killing him. The AAP leader has, however, denied all the allegations.

The violence broke out on Sunday after those protesting for and against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA clashed with each other in Jafrabad and Maujpur areas of Northeast Delhi. The violence later spread to nearby localities like Chand Bagh, Yamuna Vihar etc.

Sharma, the young IB official, came home from the office and went out to see what us happening when the mob captured him and dragged him into Hussain's house, said his brother Ankur. The protesters, with guns and swords in hands, did not let Ankur and his friends rescue Sharma, said the family.

The locals too claimed that Hussain had instigated the rioters who went on rampage and burnt houses and vehicles in the area.

Though the authorities immediately sprung into action to control the violence, a blame game started between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress and AAP.

The Congress accused the BJP government at the Centre and AAP of doing nothing as the violence spread; the BJP hit back, saying it started because of the inflammatory statements made by Congress and AAP leaders and questioned the selective silence of the two parties.

BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who has been facing fire over his alleged inflammatory remarks hours before the violence broke out, took on AAP and said the party is trying to save Hussain. Mishra had accused Hussain of killing of the IB officer.

Mishra is considered close to Vishvas; he had even backed the poet-politician when he had questioned the party leadership for defeat in 2017 municipal elections.

Vishwas was one of the co-founders of AAP but due to differences with the party's top leadership, especially Kejriwal, had distanced himself from the affairs of the party. He had earlier raised his voice against Kejriwal.",,,
161,,"The recent incident involving an Uber driver deciding to take his passengers to the police station because they were coming from anti-CAA protest and were discussing the same in the vehicle has evoked widespread comment. It is an understandably scary prospect when individual citizens decide to don the role of vigilantes and sit in judgment on what constitutes an anti-national act.

Viewed from the Uber driver's perspective however, it is clear that he thought that he was doing a good thing, something truly noble. In his scheme of things, the people in the car were traitors, anti-nationals bent on dismantling the country. It is possible, at the risk of being presumptuous, that this was one of the most significant achievements of his life, this willingness to step up for the cause at some risk to his means of livelihood. There might have been some doubt in his mind about what action to take, and by his own admission, he contemplated a far worse fate than merely taking them to a police station, but he hadn't the slightest doubt that he was in the right. That the party in government and responsible for the maintenance of a rule of law chose to felicitate him would only crystallise this belief.

This is true of many of those who are willing to commit acts of violence in the name of the nation or in the defence of their religion. For most of them, it is not a self-serving pursuit involving any significant material gain. There would be those that are cynically and knowingly manipulating the truth for political ends, as also those that have a commercial interest in toeing this line, but there is large mass of supporters that are true believers. The strength of this belief can even make them willingly accept an obvious lie as the truth; since they know the larger truth, the smaller lie is deemed inconsequential.

All around the country, a virulent form of nationalism is being weaponised, and more importantly being internalised as a duty. Media is playing a huge role in normalising this. In his statement framing the results of the Delhi exit polls, a leading TV anchor described the citizens of Delhi who seemed set on voting for the AAP as having no

interest in issue like the abrogation of Article 370, nor in the CAA and were thus not interested in safeguarding the interests of the nation. To his mind, the entire population of Delhi was treacherous because in a state election, they apparently chose to vote for the party that offered a better everyday life in concrete and measurable terms. Some might have thought of it as the BJP's failure, but to this gentleman it was clear than an entire city had turned rogue.

Till a little while back, we had dog whistles of many kinds- sly and artful references that cast Muslims and liberals as anti-national, now we have blaring foghorns. It becomes possible to characterise a gathering of women and children in the heart of the capital, a gathering that has stayed resolutely peaceful in the wake of many provocations, as being the nerve centre of a terrorist plot. Just uttering the name Shaheen Bagh is enough, for it evokes images that need not adhere to or derive from any form of reality.

While it is true that the role of media in normalising this discourse cannot be overstated, it would be delusional to believe that nationalism does not work at a much deeper level. The appeal of nationalism, particularly among the young, needs to be better understood. Given the economic situation of the country and the looming crisis of employment, there is a growing anxiety and a simmering sense of anger that is looking for an address, a destination that it can direct itself at. One would have thought that the most likely target of this anger should have been the government, which is the primary agent responsible of ensuring that it is creating enough jobs. But the BJP's success has been in making nationalism a much more pressing and immediate issue than issues that would otherwise have been considered pressing and immediate- the small matter of findings jobs, earning good livelihoods and meeting the many aspirations that have been activated in post-reform India. All of us look for our basic needs to be met but we also look for a sense of purpose, and as an assurance that we are significant and that our actions count for something and this is what the ruling party is so effectively speaking to.

To find meaningful employment is difficult, but to be an activist for a right-wing nationalistic cause is so easy. All that one needs to do is settle back into an identity that one was born with. It needs no additional effort, no striving of any kind, and little risk. One is part of the dominant majority, one has numbers and the backing of the state on one's side, which will protect you if do commit any acts of violence. One can simply by deciding to become part of the movement, exercise real power over one's immediate surroundings. One also experiences a heady sense of belonging, an elevating feeling of being part of some martial mission to cleanse the country of its ills. Those that oppose this, are by definition the enemy. And as everyone who is right-minded knows, it is the majority that is under threat, and that its actions are pro-actively defensive. As a prominent ruling party leader has asserted, if we don't beat back the minority today, Mughal Raj is not far from coming.

The change is real and is likely to be irreversible. For a lot of Indians, the case has been closed. The lines have been drawn. Hate is not a choice, but a duty. And it gives hope, succour and a true sense of purpose to people who think of themselves as good and righteous human beings.",,,
162,,"NEW DELHI: After addressing three-four rallies a day other than roadshows, Union home minister Amit Shah holds meetings with constituency coordinators for the Delhi elections till around 2am in the state party office, receiving feedback about campaign and the party's prospects.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking a back seat after an initial rally that made headlines for his assertion that a nationwide national register of citizens had not been discussed in government, Shah has taken charge of the Delhi campaign, virtually becoming its face. This marks a significant change from the pattern since late 2013 when Modi led the party into battles with Shah, as the BJP chief, playing an able deputy.

Delhi elections 2020 news live

While whether Modi will enter the campaign fray in the last few days remains to be seen, Shah taking the pilot's seat has occasioned surprise and has set tongues wagging. The Union home minister's intense engagement has also boosted the campaign, which had at the time of the announcement of the election schedule seemed floundering. It has raised the morale of the cadre.

A tireless campaigner, Shah has been addressing rallies in constituencies bringing about a connect with the voter, which perhaps may not be forged by the large rallies addressed by the PM.

He not only tweets, but also monitors the party tweets and interacts directly with ""cyber warriors"" deployed at several levels to counter opposition -- mainly AAP -- campaign.

Giving the campaign a higher profile, Shah will address a joint rally with JD(U) president and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar in Burari on February 2. The absence of big rallies and the PM's participation has sparked speculation whether the perceived upper hand of AAP has been a deterrent as Modi had led the way in all assembly elections since 2014. In the meanwhile, Shah has immersed himself, making the stakes of the BJP top brass evident.

Shah's combative ""all in"" style and sharp references to AAP's efforts to skirt issues like Shaheen Bagh as well as his aggressive questioning of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's record has given the BJP campaign a bounce. How far it goes remains to be seen though it has forced Kejriwal and senior AAP member Manish Sisodia to respond to BJP's charges. The stage may be set, BJP sources said, for Modi to address rallies after the Union Budget presentation. ""One rally of the PM will be held in east Delhi at Karkardooma on February 3. The other rally will be in Dwarka on February 4,"" a party member said.

""After completing official assignments, Shah moves to the campaign trail, holding at least three-four meetings and roadshows almost each day,"" said a party functionary, who has been accompanying the minister. He said the party strategy meetings start late evening and conclude well past midnight.

Shah's involvement in Delhi polls reminds of his campaigning in Gujarat and Karnataka polls in which he had campaigned and spent time with party cadres. As the party has planned hundreds of corner meetings, Shah will take centre stage, possibly addressing another 30-odd big and small meetings.

""He is addressing rallies with a crowd from 5,000 to 50,000 not caring about the size of the venue and area,"" a party functionary said. Even on Republic Day, Shah took out a roadshow in minority-dominated Ghonda assembly constituency, which the party said evoked a good response. Party members say Shah's strategy has been to attack Kejriwal, highlight the performance of the Centre and accuse the opposition of ""appeasement"" politics in context of Shaheen Bagh and anti-CAA protests. ""Apparently BJP feels that Congress is not in a contest on more than six-seven seats,"" a functionary said.",,,
163,,"AAP leader criticises Yogi Adityanath's 'death wish' remarks on CAA violence

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleged on Thursday that the BJP-led dispensation at the Centre did not have any intention to put an end to the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest at Shaheen Bagh here, saying ""it suits the government in pursuing its polarising agenda"".

""The Delhi Police is under the Central government and they do not want to solve the Shaheen Bagh protest. They want to polarise the society as it helps their politics,"" AAP leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh told The Hindu. He also said that the BJP wanted to divert the attention from real issues such as unemployment and poor financial situation of the country using the CAA.

AAP also hit out at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, saying he should decide whether he stood for justice or in support of rapists.

""If the Narendra Modi government was serious about ending the Shaheen Bagh protest, it would have followed up on the assurance given by its law minister on taking the path of dialogue and honest engagement with the anti-CAA protesters. It suits the Modi government that the protest continues because it indirectly helps it in pursuing its agenda of polarisation,"" Mr. Singh said at Aligarh Muslim University here, earlier in the day.

He alleged that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's statements showed ""his prejudiced mind"" against the AMU. ""The Chief Minister seems to be totally unaware of the AMU's contribution to the country and his outburst is a result of this ignorance,"" Mr. Singh said, adding that the utterances of Mr. Adityanath suggested that ""he is losing his mental balance"".

Mr. Adityanath defended the State police on Wednesday over the deaths of anti-CAA protesters, saying they were shot by other rioters and nothing could be done to save someone with a ""death wish"". Wrapping up the discussion on the Governor's address in the State Assembly, he said the role of the police in dealing with rioters during the CAA protests should be appreciated.

Mr. Adityanath said his government supported democratic protests but would maintain law and order by dealing strictly with those indulging in violence.

Mr. Singh alleged that instead of focusing on good governance and improving law and order in the State, Mr. Adityanath was trying to divert the attention of the public. Under Mr. Adityanath, U.P. was becoming notorious for ""rapists"", he said.. He denied that his party was strategically tilting towards a ""soft Hindutva"" policy to present itself as a national alternative to the ruling BJP.

Referring to the AAP government's policy on the NPR, he said, ""We are looking into certain additional information that is being sought this time under the revised format.""",,,
164,,"Shaheen Bagh protest has been making the news for over two months now. Petitions had been filed in the Supreme Court (SC) against the illegal occupation of the road by the protesters that resulted in denial of the road to lakhs of commuters daily. The petitioners prayed for eviction of protesters from the road. The court finally heard the petition and constituted a three-member team to negotiate with protesters and reason with them to clear the road for traffic. The court held their right to protest as long as it was carried out at designated sites and not on public roads.

In a democracy like India, it is government's responsibility to take executive action while the courts, as guardians of the constitution, can only pronounce on validity and correctness of actions of the government in case the same are challenged by any citizen. The petition for eviction of protesters from the road is primarily an executive action and therefore one is surprised that SC even agreed to hear it. In all fairness it should not have been entertained by the honorable court and petitioner should have been directed to approach the government for evicting the protesters. Instead the court has taken on itself the mantle for executive action by constituting a three-member team to negotiate with protesters. This, perhaps is a wrong precedent that may invite misuse in years to come. Will mediation prove successful? In all probability it will not. In that case what will be the next step by SC? The court has already indicated that denial of usage of road to public is wrong. So, does SC have any other option but to ask police and other concerned authorities to clear the road by force? A decision that logically should have been arrived at by the government long back.

Shaheen Bagh case is a clear case of mismanagement and shirking of responsibility by police and administration on one hand and political exploitation by all parties on the other keeping in view Delhi's elections. Did central government ask Delhi police not to act since the state police is under the Home Ministry? Afterall BJP did use Shaheen Bagh protest as part of its political campaign to win votes of people who were against the same. Aam Admi Party (AAP) was sympathetic towards the protesters and it wooed Muslim voters successfully. Most other opposition parties too showed varying degree of support for the protest since it was anti BJP in nature and that suited them.

If police had acted at the initial stages itself when the protest started, it would have been a routine matter for them. After all, the same police has managed to keep counter protests by those who are opposed to Shaheen Bagh protest in check. Today, it is an entirely different ball game as this protest has acquired an iconic status across the nation. The protesters have declined Home Minister's offer for their leaders to come and discuss their reservations on CAA. They have even spurned the efforts of SC appointed committee for a negotiation for last two days. Instead they are demanding that either Prime Minister or Home Minister should come to the protest site to discuss with them. They have indicated in no uncertain terms that unless CAA is taken back and an assurance given that there will be no NRC, they would continue to protest and block the road. It appears they are in a mood to defy even the SC.

The moot question here is what is emboldening these Muslim protesters to this extent? Surely a few Muslim women, mostly above sixty years of age, cannot be assumed to have taken over the protest leadership as is being projected by organizers of the protest. Most of these women may have never stepped out of the neighborhood where their homes are located without their menfolk accompanying them. They hardly give the impression of being socially active or highly educated or aware of what is happening in the nation. All that they seem to know is that CAA is anti-Muslim and BJP government is anti-Muslim. If these ladies were genuine leaders and knowledgeable on CAA and NRC who were acting on their own, it is possible they may have accepted Home Minister's invite for discussions. The fact that they did not only proves, what most believe already, that they are just a front. The real master minds of the protest have a larger sinister agenda and they are pushing it from behind these burqa clad ladies. These organizers have neither any desire to enter into any discussions on CAA (or NRC) nor come to the fore for the time being to reveal their identities.

So, what can be the sinister agenda that may be taking shape behind the scenes in Shaheen Bagh? Whatever be its final motive, one thing is certain. The real organizers want violence to erupt at some point of time because a mere peaceful protest, as is going on currently, will not serve their purpose. There are two scenarios that could see the onset of violence. First, if there are counter protests from non-Muslims and they forcefully try to open the road, clashes will take place between the two groups. Next, if police try to evict the protesters forcibly, once again clashes will take place. In both these cases, given the Muslim mindset, it may not be farfetched to assume that the organizers may ensure that a few ladies suffer serious injuries, or even an odd fatality, as that will serve their cause to no end. They may even push a few children to the front lines for a similar effect. Once that happens, it will not take much for protests to spread like wild fire across the nation as most Muslims may take to the streets. In such an eventuality communal clashes will abound and many parts of the country will be up in flames. Involvement of Rohingya Muslims in a big way, in the violence that may ensue, cannot be ruled out. Afterall one part of the sinister agenda of current anti-CAA protests is to ensure that no Rohingya Muslim is deported from India. With these Muslim immigrants present in large numbers in states like Assam, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, this could be a very dangerous game indeed.

Once violence spreads, Muslim leadership, with help pf opposition and other supporters, will blame BJP and central government for atrocities against Muslims and harp on BJP's anti-Muslim stance. In addition, it is likely that they will target Mr Modi and bring back 2002 Gujarat riots into focus once again. He will be blamed for carrying forward the 2002 Gujarat agenda at national level. While all this is happening, there will be some anti-India elements that will try and ferment trouble in Kashmir valley with help from across the border. That will ensure Kashmir is on the boil once again and normalization process comes to a halt. It will not matter to any Muslim that in last five years, it was same Mr Modi and his government that helped them to build toilets in their homes, avail gas subsidies, ensured their financial inclusions by bringing banks within their reach and other such novel schemes aimed at making life more livable for all Indians including them without any bias.

Unfortunately, that is the nature of their society since their allegiance is only to their religion and nothing else.

A disturbed and economically weak India engulfed in communal clashes suits the sinister designs of those Muslims who want to either break India or turn it into an Islamic nation at some point of time in not too distant a future. Veiled threats in this regard have already been heard at the protest site many times in last two months. The only way to defeat this sinister agenda is for India's 85% population to stand together with a strong national leadership that believes India is the homeland for Hindus and those minorities who live in harmony with them. That perhaps is the only way Hindus and these minorities, who have a history of living harmoniously with Hindus, would retain India as their nation while keeping the Muslim minority in check.

It is time for a reality check for Hindus to decide on the future of their country, a land that boasts of Lord Shiva, Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, Gautama Buddha, Mahavira and Guru Nanak. A land that has a history dating back to over 6000 years and has given the world inventions and thoughts like the numeral system including the concept of zero, carburized steel, art of weaving cotton textiles, confirmation of presence of water on moon, unmatched knowledge contained in Upanishads and Vedas, basics of wireless communications, advanced understanding of medicine and surgery, religious tolerance, concept of non-violence, understanding of democracy and importance of gender equality. In short, there is a lot at stake for Hindus and it is time for all, without exception, to stand up for what is right for India and Indians.",,,
165,,"NEW DELHI: Blaming the ruling BJP and the central government for communal violence in the capital, Congress president Sonia Gandhi Wednesday demanded that home minister Amit Shah resign from his post for his ""colossal failure"". She accused the Centre and the state government of AAP of ""deliberate inaction"".

Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters, accompanied by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sonia asked Amit Shah to answer what was he doing for last three days since trouble broke out in the city. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra later led a Congress march to demand Shah's resignation but was stopped midway by the police.

Saying the ""tragic events since Sunday have a history, design and pattern .... a well-planned conspiracy"", she said Delhi assembly elections gave away the plan as ""BJP leaders made inflammatory statements clearly intended to create an atmosphere of fear and hate."" She particularly referred to the recent statement of Delhi BJP leader Kapil Mishra, albeit without naming him, ""who gave an ultimatum of three days to Delhi police and warned that 'after three days, don't tell us anything'.""

Priyanka Gandhi told reporters, ""What BJP leader Kapil Mishra has said is shameful and the government not doing anything is even more shameful.""

Asked if Congress feared that violence could spread to other areas like in Gujarat, Sonia said, ""It is true that we fear that it may spread to other parts. That is why we have spelt out what needs to be done to quell the violence here."" She termed as ""shocking"" the silence of the leadership in central and state governments.

The strong statements came after a hurriedly convened Congress Working Committee met on Wednesday morning to express concern over the violence in northeast Delhi and passed a resolution putting the Centre and the state government led by Arvind Kejriwal in the dock. It slammed the Delhi government for not activating the administration to reach out to people to appeal for peace.

""After reviewing the situation, the CWC is of the firm opinion that what has happened in Delhi is a colossal failure of duty for which the entire responsibility must be borne by the central government and particularly the home minister and calls upon the home minister to tender his resignation immediately,"" the resolution said.

At the CWC meeting, Sonia is learnt to have noted that violence happened a few kilometres away from the home minister's residence and during the US President's visit. In what was a reference to the anti-CAA demonstrations, she said the right to protest was a citizen's right and people were being targeted for holding views different from the ruling party.

""Where was the home minister and what was he doing since last Sunday? Where was the chief minister and what was he doing since last Sunday?"" the CWC resolution asked.

During the discussions, a suggestion that the Centre should be questioned about not deploying the Army was shot down by senior leaders like P Chidambaram and Anand Sharma. It was felt that the demand would give the BJP regime a license to send Army anywhere in future. ""Let us not set this precedent,"" it was argued, according to a leader present in the CWC meeting.

Priyanka told the meeting that the party should be seen on the ground. She said Congress workers should go beyond social media and visit people, visit hospitals if they cannot visit localities.

Congress will meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday and submit a memorandum on Delhi riots. While the party wanted to go to the Rashtrapati Bhavan after the CWC, it was informed that the President was busy with the visit of the Myanmar President.

The CWC called for deployment of adequate security forces, formation of ""mohalla peace committees"" and posting of senior bureaucrats in the districts. ""The CM must be visible in the affected areas and in constant communication with the people,"" it said.",,,
166,,"The real challenge for AAP and its chief will come in other States as and when they decide to take the plunge.

As Arvind Kejriwal took oath as Delhi's Chief Minister for the third time on Sunday, one question that lingered repeeatedly was: what next for him?

Will he expand his politics beyond Delhi? Will the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) once again look at Punjab where it had once flourished but now seems to have disintegrated? Will he foray into other States to acquire the political heft that he needs to project himself as a 'national leader'?

Such questions are asked whenever a political leader achieves a certain amount of success in his/her home turf. For example, when Narendra Modi won Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections for a fourth term in 2012, questions were asked if his next goal would be to lead the nation -- which he eventually did.

Political observers had noted how Mr. Modi had spoken to his fellow Gujarati voters in Hindi, while expressing his gratitude for the love they showered on him and his desire now to contribute towards the nation's growth.

So, has Mr. Kejriwal given any such hints in his speech after taking oath? Apart from expressing his love Delhiites and his desire to work with Mr. Modi for a better Delhi, there were no overt suggestions.

But the clues lie elsewhere -- in the radio messages, delivered in Mr Kejriwal's own voice, where the AAP chief spoke of Bharat Mata's every child getting employed, the sweat and toil of every farmer reaping profits, women feeling secure and so on. In the posters outside AAP headquarters, where it gave out a missed call number to get associated with 'Rashtra Nirman' (Nation Building), a word over which the BJP has almost claimed political patent.

If Lord Ram was an inseparable part of Bharatiya Janata Party's politics, Lord Hanuman is now AAP's mascot. From reciting Mr. Kejriwal reciting Hanuman chalisa to the party distributing calendars with Lord Hanuman's photo at the oath taking ceremony, AAP has developed its cultural symbols to go with its politics.

Analysts have termed this as being a more inclusive 'cultural Hindu' as opposed to hardline Hindutva politics of his rivals.

But this evolution of being a 'cultural Hindu' ensures that Mr. Kejriwal studiously kept out of university campuses -- Jamia Milia Islamia (JMI) and the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) -- that had seen protests and violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and fee hikes. He also stayed away from Shaheen Bagh protestors.

Mr. Kejriwal's opposition to the CAA or support to the JNU came in the form of tweets. As he went about seeking votes on the basis of his government's work in the area of education, public health or public transport, many commentators believed that the AAP chief wanted to avoid 'getting caught' in a polarising narrative or being labelled as part of the 'tukde tukde gang'.

But the strategy seems well beyond the Delhi elections. The AAP chief is laying claim to, if not reclaim, the cultural and religious symbols that endeared his rivals to the majority Hindu community, a tactic that the Congress too adopted in State-specific elections such as Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.

It is in this backdrop that the BJP's attempt to call him a terrorist didn't succeed in Delhi and may not do so nationally.

The real challenge for AAP and its chief will come in other States as and when they decide to take the plunge. Delhi minister Gopal Rai indicated nation-wide recruitment for AAP that neither has a robust organisation nor identifiable leadership outside Delhi.

It's influence in Punjab, the only State outside Delhi where it posed a challenge, too has been in the wane. Though there are rumours that though a sulking Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned as minister from Amarinder Singh government, could be roped in to revive the party in the State.

With the Congress party in a State of disarray, a few young leaders may see a future for themselves in AAP as an alternative platform.

So, the formidable challenge of building a robust pan-India organization will certainly weigh on Mr Kejriwal's mind while answering what next for him and his party.",,,
167,,"NEW DELHI: The Special Investigation Team of Crime Branch has sent a notice to the father and brother of Kapil Baisla, the Shaheen Bagh shooter, to join the probe. After giving a video statement on Tuesday, Baisla's father, Gaje Singh, and brother switched off their mobile phones and refused to join the investigation. It was found that the phone from which police had recovered the photographs of Baisla and his father joining AAP had only a handful of numbers saved, mostly belonging to his friends.

Police suspect he was using another phone, which he did not mention during interrogation. Cops has been focusing on the WhatsApp group which he was a part of. The group's details have been retrieved and members who made objectionable statements will be called in for questioning.

Sources said during his questioning on Wednesday, Baisla kept evading questions regarding the reason behind the firing. He kept changing his statement on his association with the group, whose members wanted to act against the anti-CAA protesters. ""His versions are being put on record,"" said a police officer.

Baisla's friend, Sarthak, was arrested and questioned. His statements were found to be contradictory. Baisla was taken to Shaheen Bagh on the route he had travelled to establish his claims.

Cops are trying to establish a conspiracy since Baisla claimed that he had bought the weapon seven years ago, but couldn't identify the seller. He kept changing his statement regarding the identity of the arms dealer. A manhunt has been launched to track down the dealers named by him.

Meanwhile, reacting to the allegations of violating the model code of conduct, a senior police officer said that some facts related to Baisla emerged during the course of investigation.

Tight security arrangements have been put in place at various centres across the national capital where the counting of votes polled in the February 8 Assembly elections will take place on Tuesday.

The curiosity among people to know the outcome of the elections to the 70-member Delhi Assembly has heightened post-exit polls, that has forecast a big win for the ruling AAP, and the delay in announcement of the final voter turnout by authorities.

The election, seen as a contest between AAP and the BJP, which went aggressive during the high-octane campaign, was held on Saturday, sealing the fate of 672 candidates -- 593 men and 79 women.

Nearly 24 hours after the polling ended in Delhi, the Election Commission on Sunday announced that the final voter turnout was 62.59%, 5% less than 2015, and asserted that it followed the laid down process to compile data, after AAP questioned the ""delay"".

Authorities in the Delhi CEO office are gearing up for the counting of votes and adequate arrangements have been made at the centres spread across 21 location in the national capital, spanning 11 districts, officials said.

Exit polls on Saturday predicted an easy win for AAP, which sought to retain power on development plank, against the BJP that ran an aggressive campaign centred around the issues of anti-CAA protests and nationalism. Most exit polls also predicted that Congress is unlikely to open its account even this time in Delhi, which it ruled from 1998-2013.",,,

Kapil Mishra of the BJP on Tuesday conceded defeat to Akhilesh Pati Tripathi of the AAP in the Model Town constituency in the Delhi assembly election but expressed regret at the loss.

""We need to go back to the people of Delhi. We'll be a strong opposition. I regret not winning. We couldn't understand people's expectations,"" Mishra, a former AAP MLA who joined the BJP after a public spat with his boss Arevind Kejriwal.

Mishra who had vowed to defeat the AAP, trailed for much of the counting. Earlier in the day he had said, he expected votes in his favour in the 5th and 6th rounds of counting but wasn't very optimistic.

AAP's Akhileshpati Tripathi retained the Model Town seat for AAP, thanked Kejriwal for trusting him.

""This will send the message across the country that only the politics of development will win henceforth,"" he said.

He also took a swipe at Mishra who had been in the thick of controversies during the election campaign due to his comments, most infamous of which was his encouragement to a crowd of BJP supporters gathered in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that chanted ""Desh Ke Gaddaron ko, Goli Maaro Salon Ko"" (shoot the anti-nationals) while referring to those who sat in protest against the act.

""Gone are those days when someone could think of winning by instigating the voters just before elections,"" Tripathi said.

During the campaign Mishra had also suggested that Shaheen Bagh protestors were sponsored by Pakistan and had likened the elections to an India-Pakistan cricket match.

A day before counting of votes on Monday, Mishra told a news agency that the ""people's mandate"" was with the BJP and he wouldn't be surprised if Kejriwal lost from the New Delhi constituency.",,,

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

The election, largely seen as a battle between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP, which went aggressive during the high-octane campaign, was held on Saturday, sealing the fate of 672 candidates -- 593 men and 79 women.

Nearly 24 hours after the polling ended in Delhi, the election commission on Sunday announced that the final voter turnout was 62.59 per cent, five per cent less than 2015, and asserted that it followed the laid down process to compile data, after the AAP questioned the ""delay"".

Authorities in the Delhi CEO Office are gearing up for the counting of votes and adequate arrangements have been made at the centres spread across 21 location in the national capital, spanning 11 districts, officials said.

The counting centres are located at CWG Sports Complex in East Delhi, NSIT Dwarka in West Delhi, Meerabai Institute of Technology and G B Pant Institute of Technology in Southeast Delhi, Sir CV Raman ITI, Dheerpur in Central Delhi, and Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Bawana in North Delhi, among other places.

There will be 33 counting observers, officials said.

There were 13,780 polling booths where every vote was accounted for by the presiding officers which is a time-consuming exercise, Sandeep Saxena, senior deputy election commissioner, said at a press conference on Sunday.

Critical and vulnerable polling locations, numbered 545 and spanned 3,843 booths.

In view of the ongoing anti-citizenship law protest in Shaheen Bagh, the Delhi CEO's office had put all five polling stations in the area under the ""critical"" category.

Security personnel kept guard at strong rooms storing electronic voting machines (EVMs).

Delhi chief electoral officer Ranbir Singh, a day ahead of the polls, had said all EVMs have been tested and they are ""foolproof and non-tamperable"".

Exit polls on Saturday predicted an easy win for the AAP, which sought to retain power on development plank, against the BJP that ran an aggressive campaign centred around the issues of anti-CAA protests and nationalism.

Most exit polls also predicted that Congress is unlikely to open its account even this time in Delhi, which it ruled from 1998-2013.

Looking to capture power after 22 years, the BJP had mounted one of the most aggressive campaigns in the Delhi assembly polls, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah leading the saffron charge on its planks of Hindutva and nationalism, and its strident opposition to Shaheen Bagh protests.

The issue often dominated the political discourse during the campaign, with many BJP leaders targeting the ruling AAP, and the Congress, accusing them of ""misleading people"" holding anti-CAA protests in Delhi.

A section of voters on Saturday claimed that the prolonged street agitation demanding revocation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was ""not an issue in the beginning of the campaign"" but ""political parties had slowly turned it into one"".

Ballimaran constituency recorded the highest voter turnout of 71.6 per cent among all the 70 assembly seats in the national capital, while Delhi Cantonment brought up the rear in polling percentage, according to data shared by officials on Sunday.

Okhla constituency recorded 58.84 per cent. Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Nagar fall in Okhla assembly constituency, where hectic polling had taken place till late afternoon.

Shaheen Bagh has been the epicentre of anti-CAA protests in Delhi, running into over 50 days now.

Protesters had taken turns on polling day on Saturday to cast votes to keep the agitation alive.

Seelampur constituency recorded a turnout of 71.2 per cent, according to the data.

The turnout in the 2015 assembly polls stood at 67.47 per cent.

Over 1.47 crore people were eligible to vote in the Delhi polls, including 2,32,815 in the age group of 18-19.

Voters in various categories included males (81,05,236), females (66,80,277), service voters (11,608), third gender voters (869), and senior citizens (aged 80 and above) voters (2,04,830), officials said.",,,

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has said the drubbing that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered in the Delhi Assembly polls is part of a political churn that the country has been witnessing in the recent times.

The party's failure to secure absolute majorities in six Assembly elections in a row was reflective of the changing narrative from communal and nationalist jingoism to livelihood issues that affected large sections in the country, he added.

Delivering the golden jubilee memorial lecture on the theme 'Challenges of Indian Democracy - a contemporary perspective', organised by the Loyola College of Social Sciences, here on Tuesday, Mr. Yechury said the public had realised the need to raise issues that concerned sustenance and livelihood, rather than fall for the trap of communal polarisation that the BJP sought for its success.

While there was virtually no opposition for the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana, the public took up the role to dampen their prospects.

Crediting Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for adopting a clever strategy, Mr. Yechury said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader refused to be drawn into the controversy surrounding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

While there had been undercurrents of caste factors, the victory was a vote that the people of Delhi gave for the work that was done during the last five years.

The CPI(M) leader added that the ongoing agitations against the CAA including the one in Shaheen Bagh was not led by political parties, but by the common populace, particularly the student community.

He also reiterated that the implementation of the NRC would lead to complete chaos in the country.

College manager Sunny Kunnappallil presided over the programme.

Principal Saji P. Jacob and Vice Principal Sabu P. Thomas also spoke.

Lashing out at the Gujarat government for constructing walls to conceal slums ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's visit, Mr. Yechury said it was reflective of the Centre's philosophy of ""eliminating the poor and not poverty"". He cautioned the Narendra Modi-led government that it would be making a fool out of itself by creating a charade of prosperity in the country. ""The walls will display its most inhumane face to the world,"" he said. He added that the U.S. President's visit was in reality a reciprocation to the Modi government's efforts to open the doors for foreign investment in the country.

The CPI(M) leader also questioned the denial of permission for British MP Debbie Abrahams to visit the country.",,,

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Tahir Hussain is under fire after allegations that he is involved in the killing of Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer Ankit Sharma. The 26-year-old IB official's body was pulled out of a drain on Wednesday in Chand Bagh area in Northeast Delhi, which has seen worst riots in the last two decades.

The drain is close to Hussain's house and Sharma's family has blamed him of leading the mob to kill the 26-year-old.

Hussain is the councillor from Ward number 59, Nehru Vihar, which comes under Mustafabad assembly constituency in east Delhi and is about seven kilometres from Chand Bagh. He won the municipal election in 2017.

The 42-year-old was the richest candidate in the ward in 2017 municipal elections as he had declared assets worth Rs 16 crore in the affidavit. Of the 13 affidavits analysed by Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR), on average, the candidates from Nehru Vihar own Rs 1 crore in net assets.

Hussain had further said in his affidavit that he is a businessman and there are no criminal cases against him.

The AAP leader has denied any involvement in the riots or Sharma's death. In a Facebook post on Thursday, he said that protesters had broken into his house on February 24, after which he contacted the police and they whisked him and his family away. ""The police then took control of the building. When i returned on February 25, the people in the area started raising slogans against me. The police then advised me to leave the area, and I have not ben to that house since then. I don't know who did what in that house,"" Hussain said in the post in Hindi.

People in the neighbourhood have alleged that Hussain played an active role in the riots that engulfed the area since Sunday. Some unverified videos have gone viral on social media where a man appearing to be Hussain is seen with a stick in his hand, based on which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leader Kapil Mishra have upped the ante against AAP.

The AAP leader had released a video earlier on Thursday in which he rejected allegations against him. ""These are lies and baseless accusations. For our safety, my family and I had moved away from our home on Monday in police presence,"" he said in the video which was released by AAP's social media head Ankit Lal.

""It is wrong to target me. I and my family have nothing to do with it,"" Hussain futher said in the video.

Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said the party's stand remains clear that strictest punishment must be taken against anyone associated with spreading violence and added that Hussain has given his statement on the matter.

""Supreme Court took the decision recognising the circumstances. It had already recognised our right to protest. In the current situation, if only SC had also seen it fit to say something about our own protection,"" said Ritu Kaushik on the 75th day of the women's protest on Thursday.

The report from SC on Wednesday had brought the women to their feet. After a cathartic spell of Delhi Police hai hai and Amit Shah hai hai, the men and women collapsed back into position, grieving the ""riots and attacks"" in northeast Delhi where some have family and friends.

""How many mothers must see sons killed for politicians to gain?"" asked Fatima. From the stage, Amna Faheem tried to calm frayed tempers: ""This fight is not of religion and it will not be allowed to become one despite all efforts. People of all faiths are here and we grieve for all who are shaheed in the violence."" Notably, the elder men were also out, taking to the stage to share animal parables that talk peace and humanity. ""All youth have to be guided.""

Fear in their heart, steel in their eyes and message of peace on their lips, Shaheen Bagh spent Wednesday afternoon in dua, a tentful of people in quiet prayer.

The chatter centred on the lives lost and grieving families. ""The instigators, the ones behind it, will all have to answer god -- call him allah, call him bhagwan.""

Talking of the massive 2019 victory for Modi-led BJP, Bushaira Parveen said: ""Vote dene ka sazaa hai ye? (Is this what we get for voting them?""

The violence came as a body blow. ""This is what they will do? They keep talking population. So, kill some, nullify documents of some, chase people out by destroying their homes and documents and those who are left, keep them under their thumb,"" said a woman, who had returned from visiting the affected families in Jafrabad. ""They should know the public is against riots. That is a fact.""

Kehkeshan Riyaz said: ""One Kapil Mishra wreaked havoc. Imagine how many Kapil Mishras would have been born had the Ayodhya verdict been in our favour.""

After every outburst, they returned to talk of their protest and the necessity to secure the ""sanctuary of peace"". ""What has happened is that their misrule and kala kanoon has brought Hindus and Muslims closer. That they cannot tolerate,"" said Bushaira.

""The plan was to fatigue us out. Let this linger, the women will get tired. The idea is to crush the andolan. We held together through very difficult days, we shall continue,"" said Zia Bano.

175,,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched an attack on continuing anti-CAA agitation at Jamia Millia, Shaheen Bagh and other places, saying they marked an effort to disrupt harmony by protesters who were using the tricolour and Constitution to mask their real intent.

He said the protesters' professed allegiance to the Constitution was a deception aimed at distracting attention from the real intent of the conspirators and called upon voters in Delhi to support BJP to stop the anarchy from spreading further.

""Jamia ho ya Shaheen Bagh, pichhle kai dino se, citizenship amendment act ko leke pradarshan hui. Kya ye pradarshan sanyog hai? Ji nahin, ye sanyog nahin, ye prayog hai. Iske pichhe rajniti ka ek aisa design hai, jo rashtra ke sauhadra ko khandit karne ka irada rakhta hai. (Whether it is Jamia or Shaheen Bagh, anti-CAA demonstrations have been going on for the last few days. Are these demonstrations random events? No, they represent a politics that is designed to destroy national harmony),"" said the PM as he asked voters in Delhi to thwart the ""mentality"" which , if not checked, can cause similar blockades elsewhere too.

The PM's aggressive remark came as he addressed his first campaign rally in Delhi and were in sync with BJP's attempt to rally the public opinion against the sit-in at Shaheen Bagh which has gone on for over 50 days now and sparked resentment in adjoining residential areas.

""Look at the huge inconvenience it has been causing to people who commute from Delhi to Noida. People of Delhi are watching. They may be silent. But they are seething with resentment over this display of politics of vote-bank. This mindset has to be checked here itself. For, if the conspirators get powerful, more roads and lanes will be blocked similarly. We cannot allow Delhi to be pushed in the throes of anarchy. We have to stop this and every vote for BJP will help its spread. Only BJP can do that,"" he said in the backdrop of an attempt by the party to blame its rivals AAP and Congress for the Shaheen Bagh blockade.

The focus of PM's attack on Shaheen Bagh, which drew loud cheers from the large crowd, was aimed at undercutting the legitimacy that the protesters have sought to garner by displaying the tricolour and carrying copies of the Constitution. The PM suggested that the display of faith in constitutionality at anti-CAA protest sites was just a stealth tactic. ""Else, they would have heeded the spirit of a series of pronouncements from courts where they have stressed that protests should not result in violence, loss of public property and difficulties to people. After all, courts derive their authority from the very same Constitution,"" he said.

Modi also alleged that AAP and Congress were the reason why the protests have persisted. ""These should have been called off after the government's assurance (that the CAA will not deprive anybody of citizenship and implementation of NRC is not on the table yet) . But AAP and Congress are playing politics and all these things have now been exposed.""

As BJP's aggressive election campaign enters the last leg, Modi sought votes by referring to the central government's initiatives for the country and the city and put spotlight on protests over CAA. Modi will address the second rally in Dwarka on Tuesday.

The PM said Delhi's development will get a major boost after BJP comes to power in Delhi. Delhi will become free of water tankers and get better sanitation. Modi urged people to come out in large numbers and vote for BJP and NDA in Delhi elections. ""Each vote polled for BJP candidates will boost my strength also. Time has come to change Delhi,"" he said adding that in the 21st century only the politics of development will work not politics of hate.

Taking a swipe at Congress and AAP, Modi said those who questioned the Batla House encounter are now saving people who raised 'tukde tukde' slogans. The PM also slammed Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who had raised questions on the surgical strikes carried out by the Army.

Aware that the tans Yamuna area where the rally was held is home to a large number of 1731 unauthorised colonies, Modi listed out the Centre giving ownership rights to over 40 lakh people living in such colonies in different parts of the city. Without naming the AAP government, the PM said it was done despite obstacles being created. The development of these colonies will get a boost after BJP comes to power in Delhi, he said.

The PM said all those living in slums in Delhi will get 'pucca' houses equipped with toilet, gas and electricity connection. In an indirect attack on AAP government which has not implemented Ayushman Bharat Yojna and PM Awas Yojna in Delhi, Modi said they will continue to obstruct welfare projects till they are in power because they know nothing other than politics. Modi touched on national issues like abolition of Article 370, construction of Ram Temple and CAA for giving citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He said the BJP believes in positivity and keeps the national interest supreme.",,,
176,,"Once Delhi Assembly results are out, we can be more sure-footed on it, says an AICC secretary

Of the 29 States, four States have so far passed a resolution rejecting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), a legislation that was cleared by Parliament on December 11.

Kerala was the first one to do so on December 31, followed by Punjab on January 17, Rajasthan on January 25 and West Bengal on January 27. Together these four States send 100 members to Lok Sabha.

Of these, only two are Congress-ruled States.

The Chief Ministers of the other three Congress-ruled States -- Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Puducherry -- have spoken out against the CAA and asserted that the National Register for Citizens will not be extended to their respective States, but a formal resolution against the CAA has not been moved in the Assembly. The official word is that the Budget sessions are scheduled for February in all the three States during which the resolution will be tabled. And there is so far no word from Maharashtra and Jharkhand where the Congress is a junior partner in the government.

The Congress feels that Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand results followed by protests against the CAA, which took the government by surprise, have opened up space for them and started an anti-government narrative which so far was missing. But the party is not sure on how prolonged focus on the CAA/NRC will impact its electoral fortunes.

The insiders say the decision to push tabling the resolution for the Budget session is primarily for two reasons. One there is a growing view in the party that discussions around the CAA has rapidly reduced down to a communal debate. ""Yes, as per our convictions we have to oppose a blatantly unconstitutional law such as CAA but the question we need to answer is does it politically help us. If there is a Hindu-Muslim polarisation on the issue, then BJP will benefit. Also this obliterates any discussion on the economy,"" an AICC secretary said on condition of anonymity.

Second, the party feels that the Delhi Assembly elections, scheduled for February 8, can provide empirical evidence on the public opinion. The party is waiting to see if the BJP drastically improves its tally from the current three seats in the 70-member Assembly based on a campaign solely dependent on the CAA. ""Once the Delhi Assembly results are out, we can be more sure-footed on the CAA,"" the AICC secretary said.

""In Chhattisgarh, the Muslim population is merely 2-3%. Madhya Pradesh also has similar numbers. In both the States, the resolution will eventually be passed but perhaps not with the same urgency like the border States of Rajasthan and Punjab,"" a leader from Chhattisgarh said.

The CAA/NRC protests continue to be led by common citizens. While the Opposition will pick the flag once the citizens' participation wanes, so far it has failed to make a collective and emphatic stance. Five key Opposition parties -- Trinamool Congress, DMK, SP, BSP and AAP failed to attend a meeting organised by the Congress of all the Opposition parties on January 13.",,,
177,,"DMK wants more federalism, less centre interference, less imposition of Hindi, less intrusion of Centre in State's rights.

The AIADMK government has presented a budget without populist schemes. DMK IT wing head and legislator Palanivel Thiagarajan, an ex-banker, contends that populist schemes might come as part of the Chief Minister's announcements and why such announcements under Rule 110 in the Assembly are bad. In an interview with The Hindu on Sunday, he accuses the AIADMK government of managing the economy badly and also talks about his party affairs.

Excerpts:

They have already projected rather massive schemes and grants and subsidies year over year. Just because the man has not announced on what it is going to be used for, it doesn't mean they are not going to do it. I believe these numbers [provided in the TN budget] are just meaningless numbers. The gap between what they said they will do in the budget, what they said they have done in revised estimates and what they end up doing eventually is huge. Even between revised estimate and final account, there has been increase. They would they would have revenue deficit of ?14,000 crore in 2019-20, but in the revised estimate the figures went up to ?25,000 crore. They have perfected the art of funny money accounting.

In the old days, Ministers did their job. But now, Chief Minister has to announce new schemes under Rule 110. I guarantee you that between now and Thursday next, the CM will make some announcements under Rule 110. This is bad not just for democracy but for administration. Bad for administration because it concentrates power on one person. Bad to democracy is the sense, what is the point of having a legislature and a Cabinet. So, I don't yet share your optimism that it is only because of debts, there are no populist schemes.

I am not senior enough in the party that I make policy decisions. My leader would tell the way. But in my professional opinion, as an ex-banker, I think we have to consider some serious restructuring because we have reached a point where the non-discretionary spending - pensions, salary, non-wage operational and maintenance expense and interest rates, has taken up almost 100% of the State's own revenue. That means there is no money left to do anything on your own. But, you cannot cut down on the first three non-discretionary spending, but you can cut down the fourth - interest rates. The cost of interest rates has escalated beyond all measures.

People who do not admit their problems, can't fix their problems. I have been saying since 2016, your biggest problem is the revenue as a percentage on GSDP has dropped dramatically. It has dropped from 14.45% during Thalaivar Kalaignar [M. Karunanidhi]'s rule to 12.67% during Ammaiyar [Jayalalithaa]'s rule to 10.4% during this rule. There are certain expenses you cannot cut out -- pensions, salaries, non-wage operational and maintenance and interest rates.

Just because you corrected your mistake [revoking public exams for Class 5 and 8], you are not me. DMK is for the Special Agriculture Zone but we are asking as to how the government is going to implement it. There are several other issues, in which the AIADMK is on other side. Why didn't they get their alliance party over exempting NEET for Tamil Nadu? DMK wants more federalism, less centre interference, less imposition of Hindi, less intrusion of Centre in State's rights. We are against CAA-NRC-NPR, we are against new educational policy but the AIADMK government doesn't seem to oppose any of these.

It's a deeply personal question. I feel that all powerful people in the world engage specialists as and when required. I have been a consultant for several great organisations. Every person, who has a unique skill, as long as they can add value to an organisation. They come and work for the organisation. Mr. Kishor has worked as a consultant for the BJP. Does it mean that he has shaped Mr. Modi's policies? Such a man should be seen as a professional, who come in as a consultant. Consultants work for all different competitors in the same industry. The reason they are brought in as consultants is that they have a broader view than internal office-bearers.

Mr. Kishor has now clearly developed a particular philosophy. He is pro Constitution, against centralisation, against autocracy, against CAA, NRC and NPC and pro federalism. He has exited JD (U) over CAA.

I am appalled. It is morally reprehensible. I am a Hindu and I have faith. And I think a true Hindu would not thrust his belief on others and in fact would defend others' faith as his own. The BJP is doing politics by dividing people based on religion. I think that is vile and uncouth and in fact, un-Hindu. My grandfather made the idol in Swamimalai and donated it to Sabaraimala. The DMK through its thiruppanis while in government has done more service to Hinduism that all Brahmins combined. I have done more to Hinduism that Mr. Ganesan and H. Raja combined.

The CAA is not a complicated law. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said ""Aap chronology samajh lijiye [You all please understand the chronology - to say that the CAB will come and then the NRC]"". Either Mr. Udhayakumar is genuinely unaware of the CAA or he is playing petty politics. Let Mr. Udhayakumar print pamphlets over CAA and carry out a campaign in support of the CAA or let him explain what Mr. Shah has said will not happen at all.",,,

Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha on Wednesday showered praises at Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who led the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to a stunning victory in the Delhi elections for the second time in a row. Sinha, who had exited the BJP to shift to the Congress ahead of last year's national elections, referred to Kejriwal as a ""super leader"" in six tweets.

""Many Congratulations to the super leader #ArvindKejriwal, #AAP & his entire team for the spectacular, grand victory in the #DelhiElections2020. The writing on the wall was absolutely clear, despite many obstacles, propaganda, man & obvious money power of the opponents,"" said Sinha in one of the tweets.

Sinha also didn't miss the opportunity to take a swipe at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), though indirectly, that had led an aggressive campaign against the AAP and was Kejriwal's prime rivals in the national capital. ""Jinhe naaz hai hind par, aab woh kahan hai? (Where are those who say we are proud Indians?)"" he said. But before signing off, Sinha made it clear that the comment in this tweet is in his personal capacity. The line was written by poet-lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi and used in filmmaker Guru Dutt's Pyasa. It has also been prominently displayed by those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

He also congratulated the Kejriwal family, saying the election victory is the best birthday gift for Arvind Kejriwal's wife Sunita, and Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who retained his Patparganj seat in a closely-fought contest.

""This victory has proved that negative, hatred & vendetta politics doesn't work, only service to society helps to achieve success. Best wishes especially to Deputy CM #ManishSisodia, our friend, brother, confident & sharp spokesperson #SanjaySingh, #RaghavChadha, #AtishiMarlena, #Ashutosh, well wishers, workers & supporters. Once again, good wishes to a leader with a personality in totality #ArvindKejriwal & belated warm birthday wishes to Mrs. Kejriwal & love to their beautiful children,"" said Sinha.

Sinha's disclaimer came against the background of criticism in sections of the Congress over its drubbing in the Assembly elections. The party couldn't win a single seat, scoring a duck for the second time in Delhi.

Many leaders have called for action, rather than introspection. Senior Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee even attacked fellow party leader P Chidambaram for showering praises on AAP and criticising the BJP. ""With due respect sir, just want to know- has @INCIndia outsourced the task of defeating BJP to state parties? If not, then why r we gloating over AAP victory rather than being concerned abt our drubbing? And if 'yes', then we (PCCs) might as well close shop!"" Mukherjee said on Twitter.

Sinha was the BJP's in-house critic for years before joining the Congress last year. Also called Shotgun for his piercing comments, Sinha has been targeting the BJP for months.

The former Patna Sahib lawmaker finally exited the BJP last year before the national elections when the BJP decided to field law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from the seat.

Sinha was defeated by Ravi Shankar Prasad who secured 62 per cent of the votes cast as against Sinha's 33 per cent.",,,
179,,"Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi led the barrage of criticism against the implementation of the GST on Friday, hours before the country embraced the new tax regime. ?India deserves a GST rollout that does not put crores of its ordinary citizens, small businesses & traders through tremendous pain & anxiety,? Gandhi tweeted, reflecting the sense of uncertainty that prevails upon a large section of traders. Gandhi reminded that the Congress was the original architect of the pan-Indian tax, which will replace myriad of local levies, and quipped, ?Unlike demonetisation, GST is a reform that @INCIndia has championed & backed from the beginning. But like demonetisation, GST is being executed by an incompetent &insensitive Govt w/o planning foresight &institutional readiness,? he said. The Congress, which had advocated lower tax rates, also campaigned to show how the NDA government has slapped ?Highest Ever GST Rate in the World.? With key Opposition parties such as the Congress, Left, Trinamool Congress and the RJD deciding to boycott the GST roll out event in Parliament, senior government managers appealed to Opposition leaders to rethink their position and join the landmark programme. ?They are distancing themselves from a process of reformation. I hope they will realise it by the evening, do a rethink and join us in the Centre Hall,? said Union minister Venkaiah Naidu. Economist Bibek Debroy quashed Opposition charges and told a TV channel, ?Had we waited for a perfect GST, we would have waited for many more years. This may not be perfect but look at it as a steppingstone.? Samajwadi Party, which has sided with the Opposition in the Presidential election, however, has decided to attend the GST launch ceremony. ?We oppose the GST. It?s a black law but since President Pranab Mukherjee will attend the launch, we will go as we do not want to create controversy,? Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agrawal told a news agency. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar will skip the event but his minister will attend the event. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), too, has supported the new tax regime and questioned the stand of some Opposition parties. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee dubbed introduction of GST as ?the mockery of Inspector Raj. ?At the stroke of midnight on 14th August 1947, India won her freedom. Now, at the midnight of 30th June 2017, freedom and democracy stand to face grave danger. The mockery of Inspector Raj is back,? she wrote in a Facebook post. The CPI(M), which demanded changes in the GST bill, feared an ?imminent threat of inflation and an all-round increase in the prices of consumer goods?. The party?s politburo said, ?It is estimated that there will be a revenue loss of at least Rs 1 lakh crore for the Centre and state governments. This will be a bonanza for the corporates, who are not willing to pass on the benefit of the reduced rates to the consumers.?",,,
