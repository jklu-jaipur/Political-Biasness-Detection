1,Article 370,"Jammu and Kashmir has been a theatre of muscular Hindutva nationalism, in the early decades in script and since 2014 in performance. Adopting a highly militarist approach to separatism, and shunning political process entirely since 2014, the BJP has now delivered on a promise it has long made, by abrogating the special status that Jammu and Kashmir had enjoyed in the Constitution through a combination of executive and parliamentary measures. Additionally, the State is being downgraded and divided into two Union Territories. The mechanism that the government used to railroad its rigid ideological position on Jammu and Kashmir through the Rajya Sabha was both hasty and stealthy. This move will strain India?s social fabric not only in its impact on Jammu and Kashmir but also in the portents it holds for federalism, parliamentary democracy and diversity. The BJP-led government has undermined parliamentary authority in multiple ways since 2014, but the passing of legislation as far-reaching as dismembering a State without prior consultations has set a new low. The founding fathers of the Republic favoured a strong Centre, but they were also prudent in seeking the route of persuasion and accommodation towards linguistic and religious minorities in the interest of national integration. The centralising tendencies increased in the following decades, but Hindu nationalists always argued for stronger unitary provisions and viewed all particular aspirations with suspicion. For them, Jammu and Kashmir?s special constitutional status was an impediment, not an instrument, for the region?s integration with the rest of the country.
 
The entire exercise of getting Article 370 of the Constitution effectively abrogated has been marked by executive excess. The first step was to declare by a presidential decree that the ?Governor? ? without regard to the fact that he has no Council of Ministers now to aid and advise him ? can speak for the State government and give his concurrence to any modification in the way the Constitution of India applies to Jammu and Kashmir. Second, on the basis of this ?concurrence?, the latest Presidential Order scraps the previous one of 1954, abrogating the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. Third, the fact that the State is under President?s Rule has been used to usher in a new dispensation under which Jammu and Kashmir becomes a Union Territory with a legislature and Ladakh another such territory without a legislature. In sum, a purported process to change the constitutional status of a sensitive border State has been achieved without any legislative input or representative contribution from its people. The bifurcation of States in the past cannot be cited as a binding precedent as, under Article 3 of the Constitution, the President seeks the views of the legislature of the States concerned, even if concurrence is not mandatory. In the present scenario, J&K has been represented by an unelected Governor appointed by the Centre, while Parliament has ventured to ratify the conversion of a State into two Union Territories without any recommendation from the State.

If there is a legal challenge to these measures, it would centre around whether such far-reaching steps could be achieved in the absence of a representative government by assuming that its gubernatorial administrator is constitutionally capable of using his consent as that of the entire State. Further, there is a self-enabling aspect to the Presidential Order. It performs a hop-step-and-jump feat. It hops over the requirement of the State government?s consent by declaring that the Governor is the State government. It steps over the need for aid and advice by the ministerial council by saying the Governor?s opinion is enough. And it jumps over the fact that there is no constituent assembly now by merely reading the term as ?legislative assembly?, and letting Parliament perform the role of the State legislature. Thus the President?s power under Article 370 has been used both to create an enabling provision and to exercise it immediately to modify the Order, thereby dispensing with the role envisaged for the State Assembly. While it is true that in 1961 the Supreme Court upheld the President?s power to ?modify? the constitutional provisions in applying them to J&K, it is a moot question whether this can be invoked to make such a radical change: a functioning State has now been downgraded and bifurcated into two Union Territories. It is inconceivable that any State legislature would ever have recommended its own demotion in status.


True, the special status of J&K was meant to end, but only with the concurrence of its people. The Centre?s abrupt move disenfranchised them on a matter that directly affected their life and sentiments. Moreover, that this was done after a massive military build-up and the house arrest of senior political leaders, and the communications shutdown reveals a cynical disregard of democratic norms. It appears that the current government values J&K for its demonstrative impact before the rest of the country, as a place where a strong nation and its strong leader show uncompromising political will. But that may have other unintended consequences. Geographically and metaphorically, Jammu and Kashmir is the crown of secular India ? a Muslim majority region in a Hindu majority country. Its people and leaders had chosen secular India over Islamic Pakistan, a fact that Islamists never reconciled with. The BJP?s adventurous route also has as backdrop an impending U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that will trigger an unforeseeable churn in Islamist politics in the region. Islamists have always viewed Kashmir as a component of their global grievances. Whatever its intent in enabling the full integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India, Monday?s decision to alter the State?s status could have unintended and dangerous consequences.",Scrapping J&K's special status is the wrong way to an end,The Hindu,UPA
2,Article 370,"In a momentous decision, government moved Parliament yesterday to abate Article 370 of the Constitution and supersede Article 35A, thereby effectively ceasing the special status for Jammu & Kashmir. Simultaneously, Union home minister Amit Shah introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill to bifurcate the state and create two separate Union territories ? Jammu & Kashmir with a legislature, and Ladakh without a legislature. This means that the Constitution of India shall now apply in full force across J&K and Ladakh, and the J&K legislature will henceforth not have any discretionary powers to decide who permanent residents of the territory are or provide them with special rights with respect to employment and acquisition of property.
Abrogating Article 370 has been a long-held wish of BJP which sees the provision as a historical wrong. However, the complicated history of Kashmir and the sensitivity surrounding the matter had hitherto prevented such a move. But with the current BJP government projecting muscular nationalism and enjoying significant numerical strength in Parliament, cessation of Article 370 became more doable. Given that abrogating Article 370 was part of the BJP manifesto, on the basis of which it swept Lok Sabha polls, the government has the mandate to do this. That non-NDA parties like BSP, AAP, YSRCP, BJD and AIADMK too have come out in support of the government?s move shows which way the winds are blowing.
Arguably, Article 370 had contributed to the problems in Kashmir. The state?s special powers of autonomy meant in practice arrogation of power by a tiny Valley elite, which led to a feeling of not being represented among the people of Jammu and Ladakh, as well as disaffection feeding into separatist sentiment in the Valley itself. And given that Kashmir came to be a troubled state with separatist sentiments being stoked by Pakistan with the help of cross-border terrorism, this may have been the worst of both worlds. Besides, Article 370 was meant to be a temporary provision. In that sense its cessation now is congruent with historical constitutional perspective.
That said, there are some issues with the way in which Article 370 is being nullified and the state bifurcated. Even according to the constitutional provision to abate Article 370, consultation with the J&K state assembly is deemed necessary before a constitutional order to this effect is passed. The government, however, has chosen to use the fact that there is no J&K government at the moment and substituted the latter with the J&K governor. While this approach may or may not be legally valid, it certainly bypasses wider discussion on the matter that would have been democratically sound.
Second, the logic behind converting the state into two Union territories is also not plain. True, there has been a demand for Union territory status in Ladakh for some time. But with the cessation of Article 370, the special powers accruing to the J&K assembly in Srinagar would also extinguish. Thus, it is debatable if bifurcation of the state and creation of the Union territory of Ladakh was necessary after that.
In fact, this would be the first time in the history of India that a state was being converted into Union territories ? the trend has been the other way around. Hence, given the magnitude of the decision, more all-round discussion would have been prudent. But perhaps government?s decision to push ahead with its Article 370 move was linked to external factors. With the US looking to wind down its military engagement in Afghanistan and turning to Pakistan to facilitate a peace deal with Afghan Taliban, Islamabad has been upping the ante on Kashmir.
New Delhi perhaps felt that Islamabad was gaining too much leverage in the emerging regional scenario and had to do something to counter this. Whatever the compulsions, even if Article 370 is abrogated New Delhi will have to ? sooner rather than later ? grant full statehood rights to Jammu & Kashmir and perhaps Ladakh too, for the sake of democratic governance as well as the federal principles in which India is grounded.","Changing the game in Kashmir: In nullifying Article 370 and bifurcating state, government has redrawn strategic calculus",The times of India,Neutral
3,Article 370,"India?s shock decision this week to revoke the autonomy of its restive state of Jammu and Kashmir is a crucial test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Without a change of course, he?s likely to fail.

Kashmir is arguably the worst legacy of the fratricidal partition of British India in 1947. One of more than 500 princely states in the subcontinent at the time, its Hindu ruler cast his lot with India after tribal fighters from Pakistan attempted his overthrow. The two nations have since fought three wars over the overwhelmingly Muslim territory. India controls the bulk of the state; Pakistan administers about a third and China claims a portion of its Himalayan plateau.


How India treats its portion of Kashmir matters for two reasons. One is that the state is the primary flashpoint for the world?s most dangerous nuclear rivalry; terrorist attacks there have repeatedly brought India and Pakistan to the brink of hostilities. It?s also the lone Muslim-majority state within Hindu-majority India, and thus an essential test of the country?s diversity and tolerance.

Given these sensitivities, Modi?s government might?ve approached the matter with discretion. Quite the opposite. With no warning, it revoked Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which granted Kashmir a degree of autonomy, while breaking up the state into two ?union territories? largely controlled from New Delhi. Authorities placed hundreds of local leaders under house arrest, dispatched thousands of troops to the already heavily militarized state, evacuated tourists, imposed a curfew, and cut off communications links. The parliamentary maneuvers the government used to ram through its decision were so dubious they?ve already landed before the Supreme Court.


All this hardly needed doing: Most of the special privileges afforded to the state on paper had long been whittled away in practice. Nor is anyone challenging the unique rights enjoyed by some other states in India. The clear implication is that Modi?s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was intent on eliminating rather than celebrating a Muslim-majority state.


Changing Kashmir?s status won?t do anything to ease tensions with Pakistan. To the contrary, it will further empower the Pakistani military, long the main roadblock to peace on the subcontinent. India desperately needs a real strategy to engage with Pakistan, commercially as well as diplomatically. Instead Modi?s government seems convinced it can continue to ignore, isolate and deter its rival. One result is that trade between the two countries has now broken down entirely.

Perhaps most galling, though, is that Modi neglected to bring on board those Indians with the greatest stake in his decision: Kashmiris. BJP officials insist that closer integration will improve the lives of Kashmiris by opening the floodgates to jobs and investment, but this is questionable. (Private investment in India hit a 14-year low earlier this year, while unemployment stands at a 45-year high.) In any case, a sudden influx of outside businesses would fuel paranoia and resentment among locals, as it has wherever else such policies have been tried.

The issue India ultimately needs to address in Kashmir isn?t a lack of jobs, or even Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. It?s the lack of agency felt by too many Kashmiris, exacerbated by a suffocating security presence they view as an occupation. Forcibly imposing the central government?s will over the state will only intensify those grievances.

Democracies as large and heterogeneous as India cannot escape internal tensions. But the way to relieve such pressure is to decentralize power and give citizens a greater stake in their governance, as well as more control over local resources.

Modi?s government is heading in the opposite direction in Kashmir. Until India finds some way to make Kashmiris feel like full citizens, in control of their lives and their destinies, their land will remain what it has been for far too long: a troubled place, and a threat to peace and prosperity.",India Is Making a Mistake in Kashmir,Bloomberg,UPA
4,Article 370,"The reading down of Article 370, which granted limited autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmir hereafter), by the Indian parliament on August 5, 2019, has evoked strong reactions from the supporters and the opponents of this move.  

Those in favour of repealing Article 370 have often argued that its revocation is consistent with the principles of Indian federalism (albeit in more crude terms).

They contend that while state governments may exist and deal specifically with local issues, ultimately, the federal government should reign supreme.

Following this line of reasoning, Kashmir?s special status under the constitution is an affront to the founding principles of India. To constrain the Union government?s powers to make legislation affecting Kashmiris is to elevate Kashmir?s status above all other Indian states. And that is something India?s ruling party and its supporters simply cannot abide.  

These notions certainly seem to be forthcoming in Indian Home Minister Amit Shah?s position on the special status of Kashmir. In a speech made to Parliament, he asserted ?This treaty (Instrument of Accession) was not only made with Jammu-Kashmir, it was made with the 630 princely states of the nation. The treaty was made with 630 princely states, and 370 was not there.?

The claim that Kashmir?s instrument of accession (IOA) was functionally no different to those signed by other princely states is incredibly disingenuous.

By signing the IOA, the princely states ceded power to the dominion of India regarding defence, external affairs and communications. If the process of integration had stopped there, India would have remained a loose federation of autonomous states.

The India we know today was formed through a series of merger agreements signed by the heads of princely states, which incorporated their polities into the Union of India. These merger agreements were often signed under duress with limited reference to the interests of the people they were affecting. Regardless, however, they can be perceived to have been accepted and entrenched by the acquiescence of subsequent generations residing in the state. 

A faulty argument

Kashmir is different from other princely states because it never signed a merger agreement fully accepting the constitution of India. Instead, it explicitly negotiated autonomy which was entrenched in the Indian constitution through Article 370.

The provision allowed Kashmir to have a parallel constitution, ensuring that the provisions of Indian constitution were effective in Kashmir only with the concurrence of the Kashmir assembly ?  representative body of the state.

In light of this, to claim Kashmir?s treaty was the same as that signed by 630 other states is to reduce the complex process of integration to one document. Integration was a multi-stage process that required negotiation with various princely states and unions. It cannot be condensed into a single procedure, as the BJP would have the world believe. 

One justification for the reading down of Article 370 offered by the ruling BJP and its supporters is that it would accelerate the economic development of the state. Dubious as this argument is, even if one were to take it seriously, it would call for convincing the people of Kashmir, or their elected representatives, to vote for a complete integration with India.

There is a precedent for it. The state of Sikkim signed a treaty with India in 1950, which limited the role of India to defence, external affairs and communication, similar to the IOA signed with princely states. It was only in 1975 that Sikkim was fully integrated with India after its assembly passed a resolution to this effect and was ratified by a statewide referendum. That is the democratic way!

Ultimately, however, Modi?s government seems unconcerned with historical realities in its path to reading down Kashmir?s constitutional protections. In light of this, pointing to the inaccuracies in the way Kashmir?s IOA and Article 370 are construed are unlikely to alter the position of BJP supporters and their ilk. 

What hope then is left for those in favour of upholding Kashmir?s constitutional status?

One option would be to seek a remedy under international law. This would involve making appeals to an international community that is often reticent to intervene in state matters, particularly when questions of ?territorial integrity? and sovereignty are raised.

Additionally, even if the international law could provide a resolution, its primary body, the International Court of Justice relies on the consent of the involved parties to hear matters. That nationalistic vigour with which the BJP has promoted its position on Kashmir makes it seem incredibly unlikely that it would now surrender itself to international law.  

The Supreme Court

Perhaps a more realistic prospect is a favourable ruling from the Supreme Court of India. The question of whether Article 370 is indefinitely entrenched in the Indian constitution has been a vexing one for Indian courts. The article provides that it may only be repealed in conjunction with the assent of Kashmir?s constituent assembly. That body was dissolved in 1957 and made no recommendations regarding an amendment to Article 370.


This poses a challenging issue for Indian courts as to whether the requirement for assent from the constituent assembly is a dead letter. Lower courts in India have posited that the requirement continues to operate, with Kashmir?s state government now taking the place of the constituent assembly. Some, perhaps more ambitiously, have posited that following the dissolution of the constituent assembly, Article 370 has an eternal effect.

In any case, treating the assent of the governor of the state, a representative of the centre, as tantamount to the assent of Kashmiris or their representatives, which is what the current process of abrogation of article 370 has done, would make a mockery of the notion of federalism. 

If the Supreme Court rejects these views and upholds the unilateral reading down of Article 370, an intriguing paradox comes into play for the BJP. Kashmir?s IOA, which had been entrenched in Article 370(b)(i), would be successfully dislodged from the Indian constitution.

This would relegate the IOA?s legitimacy in the domestic sphere and significantly alter the constitutional protections on Kashmiri autonomy.

Problematically though, the IOA is the very nexus of India?s claims over Kashmir, which it often reverts to in disputes with Pakistan. It is the legal validation of Kashmir?s status as de jure Indian territory.

Declaring the instrument meaningless would betray the inconsistencies of India?s position over Kashmir. It would involve undermining the very document which India relies on as a source of its authority before the international community. 

The aforementioned situation creates a paradox, which calls for immediate explanation. It seems that Modi is faced with a perplexing choice. He may either relentlessly dismiss the rights of Kashmiris or maintain India?s legitimacy in the global sphere. ",Article 370 and The Paradox of Kashmir?s Accession,The Wire,UPA
5,Article 370,"The NDA government?s decision to abrogate the special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 fulfills a nearly 70-year-old project of Hindutva parties, their promise that they would one day make the ?integration? of J&K with the Union of India a reality. The Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order 2019 supersedes the 1954 order, which included Article 35 A, and defined the state?s special status. Article 35 A has ceased to exist. Although Article 370 remains, it?s effectively dead. The government has simultaneously proposed the bifurcation of the state through the Jammu & Kashmir State Reorganisation Bill 2019, under which it will become two Union Territories, one comprising Ladakh without a legislature, another comprising Jammu & Kashmir, with a legislature.

But the special status guaranteed to Jammu and Kashmir was not a partisan or personal decision of the founding fathers of the Indian republic. It was based in the imperative of nation-building. It was a recognition of the role a Muslim majority state ? its unique demography protected by the Constitution ? would play in belying the claims on which Partition had taken place, and in strengthening the secular ?idea of India?. The developments of August 5, 2019, are in no small measure about rewriting history, changing that very demography, and bringing in a new idea of India, with the stamp of Narendra Modi firmly on it. The changes are no less than historic, they draw an audacious red line over and across the Nehruvian idea of India.

But what is this new idea of India, and how will it be given shape? What will also go down in history is the manner in which the momentous change in J&K?s status has been brought about. There is no parallel in the history of independent India for the secrecy and stealth deployed by the government to bring in something that is politically and communally contentious. To do this at a time when Parliament is in session, to present it as a virtual fait accompli to the House, may be the BJP?s way of doing business, as it believes it has the mandate. But it goes against every democratic convention and norm.

Curiously, government officials put out the red herring of a purported terror plot emanating from Pakistan to justify the induction of additional troops in the Valley and cancellation of the Amarnath Yatra. As it has turned out, these were law and order measures in anticipation of a backlash to the government?s real plans. For the first time since the 1953 arrest of Sheikh Abdullah, the government placed two former chief ministers, both leaders of mainstream political parties, under arrest.

The promise of resolving the Kashmir issue through partnership and dialogue with Kashmiris, articulated by a BJP prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and carried forward by a Congress prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was implicit in the PDP-BJP alliance of 2015-2018. It failed, yet as recently as last year, Prime Minister Modi invoked Vajpayee?s ?insaaniyat, jahmuriyat, Kashmiriyat? credo for resolution in Kashmir. It now seems that he and his trusted lieutenant believe that the people of Kashmir need not be consulted at all about their political fate, and that the use of force can overcome their opposition.

Now that the die has been cast, how the government proposes to carry this forward from here, how it will deal with the legal and political fallout and the reactions in the Valley, will decide many things for India. If the unkept promise of autonomy in Article 370 was the genesis of the Kashmir problem, the government has significantly departed from that, not just by its definitive move to scrap the constitutional guarantee of that autonomy but by demoting the state into truncated union territories that will now be governed directly by the Union home ministry through an all powerful Lt. Governor, working with an emasculated legislature.

Regional parties, such as AIADMK and TRS, that have supported the government?s move, might do well to ask themselves what they would do if the Centre decided that Tamil Nadu, with a traditionally strong regional ethos, be carved up into union territories. But the challenge for the Opposition is also more than a distant thought experiment. It is real and it is already here: A BJP that is bringing its ?core issues? ? for long relegated to the backburner ? to centrestage. A BJP with a mandate that will have its way, few questions asked.

It cannot be the government?s intention to keep voices in the Valley suppressed forever. For starters, it must release Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Sajjad Lone, leaders with a following in the Valley and in Jammu too. It must remove restrictions on movement in the Valley, allow telecommunications to be restarted. It must demonstrate that its political confidence to do what it has done in Kashmir does not flow out of the barrel of a gun or a numerical majority alone. There will be other challenges, such as the changing dynamics in the region, especially the deal with Pakistan?s help, in Afghanistan between the US and Taliban. This is hard work in progress even though the deed has been done.","Rupture in history, stitching a future",The Indian Express,NDA
6,Article 370,"The narrative around Article 370 has largely been premised on the argument that it was meant to be a ?temporary provision?. This argument draws its basis from the Marginal Note to Article 370, which contain the words ?temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir?. However, we must remember the place of Marginal Notes in interpreting a statute.  

English courts were cautious in using Marginal Notes. On different occasions, they have referred to them as a ?most unsure guide to construction? and a ?poor guide to the scope of a section?, further stating that ?rarely it might throw some light to the intentions of the Parliament? etc.

The Indian Supreme Court too, [for a long time], followed the same approach and refrained from employing Marginal Notes to interpret a statute. The Supreme Court, while interpreting an Article of the Constitution, referred to the Marginal Note, only to get a prima facie clue to the purpose of the Article, and in case of a conflict between the Marginal Note and the main provision, the Marginal Note gives way to the main provision. The approach of the Government to except, modify or amend Article 370 seems to be influenced by the Marginal Note to the Article.  

Article 370(3) gives the power to the President of India to declare that the Article has ceased to be operative and is a dead letter of the Constitution. Noticeably, Article 370(3) has a strong ?proviso?. One of the functions of a ?proviso? in an enactment, as stated by the Supreme Court, is to ?entirely change the very concept of the intendment of the enactment by insisting on certain mandatory conditions to be fulfilled in order to make the enactment workable?.

The proviso to Article 370(3), which states that the President ?shall? obtain recommendation of the Constituent Assembly before making such declaration, clearly imposes the mandatory condition on the President of obtaining the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir before the power to cause Article 370 to be inoperative is exercised. . The Constituent Assembly of J&K, which was constituted by a proclamation of the Maharaja of Jammu & Kashmir in 1951, was dissolved in 1957 and  presently there is no Constituent Assembly.  

After the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, Article 370 ceased to be a ?temporary provision? not amenable to modification and exception through a Presidential Order. This contention is best understood, if one reads the article without reading the Marginal note, for the body of the provision does not at all use the word ?temporary?.

The Constitution Order, 2019 (C.O.272)
The BJP obviously has been reading the Marginal Note of Article 370 with greater emphasis and the main provision with greater disdain and lesser care. The recent developments are an actualization of the longstanding agenda of the BJP, reflected consistently in its election manifestos ? including the 2019 one ? which stated ??We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Article 370. We are committed to annulling Article 35A of the Constitution of India as the provision is discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir??.

In order to annul Article 35A, a suitable order had to be passed under Article 370(1) and to abrogate Article 370, the President needed to make a declaration under Article 370(3), which he could not achieve without the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly, which no longer exists. The Supreme Court has, on several occasions, returned a finding that Article 370 has become a permanent provision for this very same reason, i.e. it cannot be abrogated anymore as the Constituent Assembly, whose recommendation is a requirement for abrogation, has ceased to exist.

The government of the day has achieved its objective through means that would elicit disapproval from constitutional purists. By the Constitutional Order 272, the Government has superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954 ? under which Article 35A was inserted ? and additionally, has given a fatal blow to Article 370, by replacing the expression ""Constituent Assembly? with ?legislative assembly? in order to bring about its abrogation,.  

Assault on Federalism
The position of Jammu and Kashmir is unique ? both within the Union of India and also in the Indian Constitution. Jammu and Kashmir was a princely state that acceded to the Union under special circumstances.

Gopalaswami Iyengar, while moving the draft provision (Article 306A, which was renumbered as Article 370) before the constituent assembly, spelt out those special circumstances. While elucidating the case for special treatment under the constitution, he emphasized that the Government of India had committed that the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir ? expressed through its constituent assembly ? would determine the sphere of jurisdiction of the Union over the state.

In the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly, Sheikh Abdullah cautioned ?that any suggestion of altering arbitrarily the basis of our relationship with India would constitute a breach of the spirit and the letter of the Constitution??.

Article 370, therefore, stands like a constitutional guarantee setting out the terms under which the princely state came to join the Union. Jammu and Kashmir, as a federating unit of the Union of India, joined the Union under the promise recognised by the constituent assembly of India and crystalized by the Constitution of India under Article 370. Altering those promises and modifying the special relationship in the manner that has been done under the constitutional orders is an assault on this particular federal relationship. The Supreme Court of India has recognized federalism as the basic structure of the constitution and the abrogation of Article 370 is destructive of federalism and therefore an assault on the basic structure of the Indian constitution.

Another agenda of the BJP is to ensure the construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhaya and its members often refer to the creation of Ram Rajya in India. The BJP may like to be reminded that one of the inviolable principles of Ram Rajya is ?Raghu kul reet sada chali aaee, prana jayee par vachan na jaaee? (It is the tradition of Raghu?s dynasty, to which Lord Ram belonged, that a promise given is to be honoured, even at the cost of life).  

The abrogation of Article 370 is letting go of the promise that the framers of the constitution had made to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

7,Article 370,"The contentious Article 370 is part of the history now. In a predictable move after days of troop buildup in the Kashmir valley, the Modi Government on Monday scrapped Article 370 to do away with Jammu & Kashmir?s special status and also proposed the bifurcation of the State into two union territories, Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh.

By doing so, the BJP-led dispensation hopes to fulfill its poll promise and deal with a protracted militancy movement that has been ravaging the State for past three decades.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced the decision in the Rajya Sabha, which approved the resolution and the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill. Both will now come up in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

The Government?s effort to tackle head-on the vexatious 72-year-old problem wracking the soul of the nation sent a wave of jubilation among BJP supporters and others, but provoked outrage from the National Conference and the PDP, the principal political parties in Jammu & Kashmir.

According to the resolution moved by the Home Minister, Article 370 ceases to be operative from Monday itself. ?The President on the recommendation of Parliament is pleased to declare as from 5th of August 2019, all clauses of the said Article 370 shall cease to be operative...,? the resolution stated.

Shah also moved a Bill proposing bifurcation of J&K into two union territories ? Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. The union territory in Ladakh will have no legislature like Chandigarh. The other union territory of Jammu & Kashmir will have a legislature like Delhi and Puducherry, where key subjects like law and order are with the Centre.

Shah said full statehood will be restored to Jammu & Kashmir at ?appropriate time? and after ?normalcy? returns. The Government will not allow the situation to turn into another battle torn Kosovo, he said.

The Government hopes that abrogation of Article 370 that accorded special status to Jammu & Kashmir and the consequential end of Article 35A that defines the permanent residents of the State will help in the integration of the erstwhile J&K State into the Union of India like any other state or union territories and cease special rights enjoyed by its citizens on land, business and employment.

As the Government moved a Bill to convert J&K into a union territory with an Assembly and a Lieutenant Governor and thereby the Centre wielding major power over it, the State has ?lost? its privileged status like Assembly enjoying six-year tenure, outsiders not allowed to buy land and Kashmiri women marrying outside forfeiting their rights over land in Kashmir. 

Twenty four seats which fall in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) shall remain vacant in new Assembly of J&K union territory.

Abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35-A would permit citizens outside Kashmir to move in, settle and start business in the new union territory of J&K, barring special restrictions imposed by its Government. The Union Government would now play a central role in controlling State police and land issues.

Lt Governor who will ?consult the Election Commission? will have final powers over deciding the disqualification of Assembly members in J&K. Its Assembly will not legislate on ?public order? and ?police?. Law of Parliament ?shall prevail? if a law made in State list in the seventh schedule to the Constitution ?is repugnant to any provision of law made by Parliament?.

Similarly, ?a Bill or amendment shall not be introduced in Legislative Assembly except on recommendation of the Lt Governor? on imposition, abolition, remission, alternation of any tax or relation to consolidated fund of India, seats for SC/STs would be reserved in J&K Assembly.

According to the Government, the abolition of Article 370 will ?completely integrate? the State with the Indian Union like other princely States in 1950 and its residents will enjoy equal rights like other citizens.

The large population of young Kashmiris, studying and working in other States of India will get the ?power and confidence? to be equal citizens of India, without they being categorised as a special citizen.

According to Government officials, the ease with which private and public investment will flow into both these new UTs will lead to much faster development of the economy, the development of high-quality educational institutions and the flow of a large corpus of funds to develop tourism in these underdeveloped regions, they said.

The Presidential order signed by the President of India has not scrapped Article 370. But invoking this very Article, special status of J&K has been withdrawn. Thus Article 370 is very much on the statute book, say constitutional and legal experts.

Some insignificant amendments have been made by this order such as substitution of term Constituent Assembly by the State by the Legislative Assembly of State and Sadar-e-Riyasat by the Governor of State.

Presidential Order has extended all the provisions of constitution to Kashmir.","J&K no more ?special?, Art 370 goes",The Pioneer,NDA
8,Article 370,"It?s been two months since the government decided to push through constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in Parliament. Article 370 was effectively abrogated; the state was bifurcated; and J&K and Ladakh, it was decided, would now become Union Territories (UTs). The constitutional changes ? and there is no doubt that the government had adequate mandate and legislative support for it ? were accompanied by a clampdown in the Valley. Communication links were snapped. Security mobilisation was ramped up. Political leaders, including those who had sworn by the Indian Constitution, were detained.


The government?s case was simple. It argued that restrictions were necessary to prevent violence, for ease of communication and mobility would give terrorists an advantage. This, to be fair, has proved effective, for compared to earlier protests, killings have been at a minimal. But this has come at a cost. Civil liberties and fundamental rights of citizens ? and Kashmiris are entitled to the same rights as all other Indians ? were compromised. Normal life was affected. And political mobilisation ? once again a key democratic right ? was curtailed.

It is time for a review. The government must now lift restrictions, without compromising security. It must release Kashmir?s mainstream leaders, of the National Conference, the Peoples Democratic Party, as well as other smaller forces which have participated in elections under the Indian constitutional framework. These leaders have spoken up for India in difficult of times. Terrorists have killed thousands of mainstream activists because of their pro-India stance. The continued detention of these leaders only strengthens the Valley?s radicals. Their release will benefit Delhi in two ways. For one, its ambition of bringing development to J&K cannot be fulfilled without local partners; elections in the UT would not have legitimacy without the participation of locally established forces; and democratic activity needs to find an outlet. And second, releasing leaders will allay apprehensions in the international community. The fact that the leading contender for the Democratic nomination in the US presidential race, Elizabeth Warren, has now expressed concern must caution Delhi that international attention is not fading. but growing. For India to fulfil domestic objectives, and win international support, Kashmir needs to open up.",Free Kashmir?s democrats ,The Hindustan Times,Neutral
9,Article 370,"A balm is usually administered after a bitter pill. The prime minister?s recent address to the nation, three days after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government decided to do away with Jammu and Kashmir?s special status and statehood, is perhaps a case in point. In his speech ? a barely disguised attempt to mollify an aggrieved constituency ? Narendra Modi made a number of promises. The prime minister assured his audience, among other things, a gradual relaxation of prohibitory orders, an election that would, Mr Modi is certain, lead to a ?government by the people and of the people?, as well as the speedy implementation of development. All of these pledges sound reassuring. But there is a case to argue that the people in Kashmir as well as those concerned with the goings-on in that restive state would have been far more satisfied if Mr Modi ? a stickler for deadlines ? had spelt out a concrete time frame to implement his pledges. The absence of a timetable for the restoration of statehood is certain to inflict yet another blow to the morale of a people who have expressed their resentment, time and again, against what they claim are unilateral interventions from the Centre.

There is no doubt about the fact that the BJP?s move to do away with most of the provisions of Article 370 enjoys considerable public support. The rhetoric of triumphant nationalism advocated by the prime minister and his party has even forced segments in the Opposition to toe the BJP?s line on Kashmir. But Kashmir remains sceptical of the BJP?s promises and design. Mr Modi may be aware of this simmering discontent. That could explain why the prime minister in his speech chose not to refer to some telling anomalies. If, as Mr Modi claims, Article 370 had bred only ?separatism?, why is it that its abrogation has been met with such hostility in Kashmir itself? The anger in Kashmir ? communication links with the state remain tenuous for days now ? cannot be a testimony to the oneness that the BJP claims to have achieved. The trouble with Mr Modi?s party lies in its conflation of unity with unilateralism. This aggression is against the formative idea of India itself, a vision that championed the cause of accommodation and federalism. The key to the Kashmir problem lies in resurrecting the flickering spirit of democratic assimilation.",Kashmir: Swallowing a bitter pill,The Telegraph,NDA
10,Farm Bill,"Parliament must not abridge right of MPs to take a stand in debates and votes
Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh?s refusal to conduct a division of votes on two controversial pieces of legislation on Sunday, despite persistent demands from members, was unprecedented in its sheer brazenness. The Bills in question have been challenged on constitutional and practical grounds, but that is a different point. The rules of procedure regarding voting are unambiguous that if a voice vote is challenged, ?votes shall be taken by operating the automatic vote recorder or by the members going into the Lobbies?. Even if a single member demands a division, it is required to be carried out. Quite often, a division of vote is demanded even when the outcome is predictable, in order to bring on record the positions of parties and members on a particular bill. The explanation that members were not demanding a division from their seats and the House was not in order is disingenuous. To begin with, the disorder was triggered by the Chair?s refusal to order a division. And curiously, the Chair went on to declare the Bills passed amid the din, this time unaffected by disorder. Significant amendments were sought and several parties had demanded that they be referred to a parliamentary select committee. The government?s claim that it had the numbers to pass the Bills is dubious in the wake of the skulduggery it deployed for their passage. In any case, regardless of which side has the majority, procedure is sacrosanct and voting is the foremost tool of establishing parliamentary authority. It cannot be reduced to an act of benevolence by the Chair or the executive.

The chaos that followed in the Upper House, though not unprecedented, was unsavoury. Parliament is a deliberative forum and not a theatre for protest demonstration. Regardless of the provocation, the Opposition should have adhered to decorum while articulating its concerns. But, meaningful parliamentary discussions have become infrequent, and the voice of the Opposition is often ignored. Upper House functions have been significantly curtailed by the arbitrary labelling of money bills, which bypass it. The flat out denial of a division of votes was a new low in parliamentary history. Not stopping there, eight Opposition members were suspended for one week while notice for a no-confidence motion against the Deputy Chairman was rejected at the threshold by Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu. Opposition parties have now petitioned President Ram Nath Kovind to not give assent to the two Bills passed by voice vote. There must be immediate efforts led by the executive to restore the effective and meaningful functioning of Parliament.",A point of order: On farm bills,The Hindu,
11,Farm Bill,"The passage of two key farm reform bills by Parliament with the potential to boost farm incomes and productivity should have been a historic occasion. When Parliament is called upon to perform its job of discussing, scrutinising and enacting pathbreaking legislations, the government of the day must go out of the way to ensure orderly functioning and build a consensus, if possible. Unfortunately, the Farmers? Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, did not get the solidarity they deserved.

While envisaging a big leap in agricultural trade, the legislations chip away at regulatory privileges enjoyed by state governments. This has stoked farmer unrest in some states and many non-BJP ruled states, and opposition MPs, commanding respectable numbers in Rajya Sabha, came prepared for a confrontation. Two key demands ? examination of bills by a select committee and deferment of headcount ? didn?t find favour with the government and the House chair. Checks and balances enshrined in parliamentary processes must be given their due respect. In a truncated session, MPs have had little say in the two important legislations, promulgated as ordinances earlier. A select committee could have made suggestions and amendments palatable to the opposition and useful for the government. But that was not to be.

Reliance on a voice vote hasn?t helped the government either. This allowed the opposition to question the numbers in support of the bill. A contested passage doesn?t portend well for the Centre. It could increase resistance on the ground and give momentum to protests. That could in turn hold up more reforms that are keenly needed. Citing the divisiveness, opposing states could throttle the reforms, as has happened to many well-intentioned schemes.

Opposition?s attempt to create a spectacle of protest by heckling the deputy chairman at very close quarters, breaking a mic, and tearing official papers was crass and self-defeating. A race to the bottom with no winners is evident in Rajya Sabha TV arbitrarily muting the live feed before the House adjourned, purportedly to prevent airing of the commotion to a national audience, and the MPs recording their own shenanigans on smartphones. Far from impressing ordinary citizens, the political divisiveness is deeply distressing for them. Parliament must serve to reassure the public, uphold due process and serve as an oasis of calm, reasoned debate amid a worsening economic crisis.",Lost in chaos: An opportunity to present a farm reforms package through political consensus,The times of India,Neutral
12,Farm Bill,"Big changes are afoot in Indian agriculture, driven by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at considerable political risk. Freeing up farming markets may be as significant as dismantling industrial licenses in 1991. However, if the state?s protection withers away only to reveal a few large capitalists as the new overlords, there will be chaos and misery rather than progress and prosperity.

To gauge the scale of what?s being done, picture the depth of the stasis: 119 million cultivators and 144 million farmhands ? taken together, 10 times Australia?s population ? yoked to a marketplace designed to be anti-competitive, and denied the lift in productivity that propelled urbanization from Japan and South Korea to Taiwan and China.

?It?s like a massive old table in the center of the room, crawling with parasites.? That?s how Hemant Gaur, an entrepreneur who?s bringing technology to potato farming in India, describes to me the ?mandi,? or the designated market yard in which produce changes hands. ?We dared not discard it, because how would we ever replace it??

Finally, Modi has thrown out the old furniture by ramming legislation through parliament, passed by a dubious voice vote. Now growers don?t have to bring their harvests to the mandi. They can sell it at farm gates, factories, warehouses, silos, and cold storages. The market yard remains, but can?t charge any fee on transactions outside its physical space. Trades can take place online. Farmers can enter five-year, fixed-price contracts with corporate buyers. The government will tame only excessive price increases rather than impose caps on incremental jitters; free markets will be the rule.

The repercussions will reverberate across the world?s second-most populous country. India?s sheer size as a producer and consumer means ripples may also be felt as a long-term deflationary wave in global food prices.

Gaur?s SV Agri Pvt. operates at the intersection of technology and farming. It produces and markets seeds and inputs to farmers, buys back and stores their potatoes in modern warehouses before supplying firms that make crisps and snacks. In one stroke, the 2.5% mandi tax Gaur pays in Uttar Pradesh, India?s largest state, is gone. With the more efficient procurement that makes possible, he reckons on savings of up to 10%. The efficiency gains will be shared by farmers, processors and consumers. They?ll lead to more investments in cold chains, and less wastage, a huge problem.

But without the fees and commissions, the market yards may atrophy, and the local elite that?s thrived off the system but also buffered it could lose its sway, leaving farmers at the mercy of traders? cartels controlled by corporate monopolies. This could be particularly true in the grain-producing belt of Punjab and Haryana, where the percentage cut in mandi taxes and other levies is in double digits. No wonder that political opposition will be fiercest in these northern states.

Modi has gambled big before, with some disastrous results. It?s asking a lot of people in rural India to trust him again. The ban on most currency notes in 2016 was supposed to immobilize tax cheats. It froze the economy. His goods and services tax became a compliance nightmare. Opposition parties claim that the agricultural ?reform,? too, will fail, especially since freedom from the regulated yard in the poor eastern state of Bihar 14 years ago brought the market to the roadside, with no infrastructure and no open auction for price discovery.

Cultivators? biggest fear from deregulation is losing their most important bargaining chip: minimum prices guaranteed by the state. Modi has assured farmers the support will stay by announcing prices for the winter crop, though as farmer activists have noted, the 2.6% increase for wheat is only half the cost escalation.

The need of the hour is for farmers to establish large sales organizations of their own. If state support could give them bargaining power, they wouldn?t be selling cotton to private traders for a quarter less than the guaranteed minimum. How will Modi assure base prices once the mandi system slips into disuse? The professionally run dairy cooperative in Gujarat, the prime minister?s home state, has $5 billion in annual revenue from its Amul brand of milk, butter and cheese. But that movement took shape in a very different political firmament of the 1960s, and it didn?t succeed everywhere or in all commodities.

With all the risks involved, a new farm-to-fork model is still worth it. Boosting agricultural productivity is important for societies to reach the ?Lewis turning point.? Beyond that threshold posited by the economist Arthur Lewis, surplus rural labor ceases to be a drag on urban wages and living standards. Japan got there by nearly tripling per capita output between 1950 and the early 1960s, thanks to the shakeup from General Douglas MacArthur?s postwar land reforms. After independence from the British, India missed its chance to give land to tillers, and allowed absentee landlords to remain backseat drivers of policy.

Almost 9 out of 10 Indian farmers have less than five acres. A majority carry on reluctantly, barely able to scratch out a living. Landless labor is paid to stay in villages with a rural job guarantee from the taxpayer. The pressure of feeding India?s 1.3 billion people has led to suboptimal choices, like a water-guzzling rice crop grown in abundance in Punjab that bleeds aquifers dry. The burning of the paddy residue causes unbearable pollution in New Delhi.

Expected 20-fold growth in online grocery sales over the next five years is the surest shot to end the stifling status quo, provided farmers can unite and hold their own in negotiations with aggregators. With the Covid-19 lockdown hollowing out urban production centers, the rural economy has become more crucial. But free markets should also be fair. Otherwise, India?s farmers will crawl out of a hole only to land in a ditch.","With farm bills, Modi has thrown out old furniture. It was about time",Bloomberg,NDA
13,Farm Bill,"Can the government guarantee that India won?t go the US agri-business way due to these reforms? If the implementation fails, no one can safeguard our farms.

Did our Rajya Sabha pass the farm bills in a high-handed manner? The live-stream this Sunday from the Upper House managed to record the voice vote, but bowdlerised the protests by a united Opposition altogether.

As parliament opened India?s farm-gates or business, the Opposition from Shiromani Akali Dal to Biju Janata Dal to Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam were quick to chant, ?corporatisation?, ?cartelisation? and ?East India Company?. 

It was Pratap Singh Bajwa, an MP from Punjab, who set the tone by saying that the current bill will destroy marginal and small farmers. Other opposition MPs, namely Binoy Viswam of the Communist Party of India, went on further to say this bill favours ?Monsanto, Walmart and Reliance, etc.,? and concluded by stating, ?FDI culture will finish Indian agriculture.? 

But are these fears valid?

The US bent 
The farm bills are an extension of Niti Aayog?s Doubling Farmers Incomes (DFI) report. And by opening farm-gates for corporations, Modi is applying Uncle Sam?s playbook to Indian farmers, aiming to woo ?agri-dollars? into India. Hence the government has laid stress on FDI too.     

But this shouldn?t come as a surprise as since the Green revolution, the United States has deeply influenced Indian agricultural policy. This has been done directly through collaborations in creating the Seed Act, 1966, etc and more covertly through bullying at WTO on tariffs, MSP, and imports. 

On a closer read, one can see the DFI report paraphrasing many US policy documents such as the Committee on Economic Development?s (CED) ?An Adaptive Program for Agriculture?, on issues such as ?moving cultivators to non-farm jobs?.

By opening farm-gates for corporations, Modi is applying Uncle Sam?s playbook to Indian farmers. Photo: Reuters

Mind you these policies are already at play as Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant in a recent article called it ?watershed moment for agriculture as 43% of our workforce is unshackled? due to these reforms.  He is merely echoing conclusions of the CED report. 

But that is not all. On July 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave an open invitation to US agri-business companies to invest in India after ?the historic reforms?. 

Professor Ram Gopal Yadav, an MP from Uttar Pradesh, even made acerbic remark on Sunday, saying that no farmer?s son could have created these pieces of legislation. 

The BJP?s own BKS General Secretary Badri Narayan Chaudhary made a similar comment stating ?legislation has been drafted by people who are not aware of the grassroots reality.?

NSSO data from 2016 peeks into these realities and reports that the average Indian farm household earns as little as Rs 6,426 per month. The average monthly surplus of a rural household (farm and non-farm) is mere Rs 1,413 per month. Individual farmers earn about one-tenth of a  daily wage labourer?s income. 

And reportedly, average agricultural household debt was Rs 1,04,602 versus Rs 76,731 of non-agricultural households in 2017 ? agricultural households earn a frugal 2,500 above the rural debt median. 

Chasing the agri-dollar dream

By 1930, Iowa lost half its  farms due to the crisis. Farm prices fell more than 50%. 

Agriculture was the main occupation, and so a New Deal was introduced for farmers, which promised price support on important crops such as cotton, corn, wheat ? similar to our MSP system ? to protect the farmers against market forces. 

In about 20 years, the program was left for dead under fiscal concerns and market pressures.   

The US government, to galvanise rural incomes, then created financial and credit institutions offering easy loans to farmers for machinery and purchase of more land. A new system of contracting was also undertaken by the broiler industry, backed by feed dealers, etc. A push for diversification into livestock, high value crops, etc. was also backed US government loans.

Sound similar to the Rs 8.5 lakh crore agri-stimulus package COVID-19 stimulus given by the Modi government?

Riding on easy loans, stressed US farmers were quick to buy more land, farm equipment and modernise. In fact, for some years, the yearly land inflation price overtook bank investments. Overall, business was good, but this ascent was artificially sustained through lax fiscal manipulation. Speculation was high and credit was being used to refinance other mortgages. This caused a financial crash.  

The result ? between 1950 and 1970, real farm income decreased from $18 billion in 1950 to $13 billion in 1971. The number of farms also decreased by 50%, but the income per farm rose by 46% against the national average of 76%. Total mortgage debt on American farms rose from $8 billion in 1950 to $24 billion in 1971. 

It was then that Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz gave a call-to-arms. ?Either you got big? and doubled your income ?or got out? of farming. By then it was already too late for small and medium family farms, the financial bubble had burst. In 1983 as the farm crisis erupted, net farm income dropped to $14.2 billion from its previous record of $34.4 billion in 1973. Livestock farmers ? cattle and hog, were destroyed in the crisis. Thousands of farms and in particular small and family run farms were being foreclosed, while the size of the average farm grew.

Iowa reported an increase of rural child abuse by 43.6% between 1982 and 1986. Meanwhile 1982, a handful of agri-business companies owned and controlled over 95% US corn and wheat, 90% of US oats, 80% of all sorghum leaving the US, and business was never better for them. 

Dan Morgan?s Merchants of Grain, describes how a few agri-businesses created an oligopoly owing grain cars, elevators to rural banks, investment firms, insurance, etc using many sub companies to trap each dollar the farmer spent ? whether on seeds, fertilisers or food. They are the creditor, seller and buyers, all in one.

Surprisingly, Howard Zinn?s People?s History of the United States records that southern tenant farmers were forced to buy only from company stores and given company store credits instead of paper money post the Civil war. In 1870, 90% of Texan farmers lived on credit. 

Back to 2020, US has about 2 million farms, a $425 Billion farm debt, farm income declining by 50% and the American male farmers committing suicide two times higher than his non-farm counterpart. 

The four top agribusiness corporations control 84% of all the US food supply and over 70% of the world?s grain. Rural America is ravaged by economic despondency, an opioid crisis, domestic violence and mental illness. 

The American farm dream has earned billions of agri-dollars but by making millions of US farm families? expendable commodities.  

Neo-Company Raj 
With the new agricultural reforms, Indian farms are now open for these behemoth agri-business firms. They have already digested farmers of Brazil, Argentina and so on. And they have had a taste of Indian Dal too. In 2015,  an investigation by the I-T department revealed that despite the Essential commodities act, agri-business firms caused the Rs 2.5 lakh crore Dal scam. With the ECA amendment, the culprits have been absolved. 

Sooner or later the government will need an ordinance to free land ceilings as the success of US-influenced policy depends on big farms and minimal farmers. A recent USDA report predicts that ?competitive forces will likely continue to reduce the number of small commercial farms and shift production to larger farms.? Land concentration will only increase in the US. 
Can the government guarantee that India won?t go the US agri-business way due to these reforms? God forbid if the implementation fails, no one can safeguard our farms, annadattas and food system from a Neo-Company Raj.  ","Farm Bills, Small Farmers and Chasing the Agri-Dollar Dream ",The Wire,
14,Farm Bill,"As two of three important farm bills that seek to deregulate the sale of agricultural produce were passed in Rajya Sabha on Sunday, after all three were cleared by Lok Sabha earlier in the week, the story so far: Scenes of uproar and chaos amid an Opposition protest inside the Upper House, street agitations by farmers who are defying restrictions imposed by the pandemic in Punjab and Haryana, a walkout by the sole minister of one of the BJP?s oldest partners, SAD, from the NDA ministry. What should have been a moment to pause and prepare for moving towards a much-promised reform, is now one that ranges the intended beneficiaries against it, alongside the government?s political opponents and an ally. And for this disfigured and disfiguring moment, the government cannot blame the Opposition alone. While the opposition parties may be seizing the visible unrest in sections of the farmers to score a political point, the fact is that the government has wielded a bludgeon when it could have used the subtle powers of Parliament. In fact, the forcible ramming through of the farm bills, the stubborn refusal to concede any elbow room to the Opposition, be it a discussion, a division of votes or a reference to a select committee, underlines a sobering message ? this government may be in its second term, but it does not appear to have as yet understood the importance of Parliament, and of playing by its rules.

In Parliament, and outside it too, it often seems that the government believes that the winner takes all. In a constitutional democracy, however, there are, there must be, checks and balances, spaces for the political opponent and respect for the minority. There must be an attempt to moderate differences and forge common ground ? and the greater onus for this is on the government. Already, amid the pandemic, parliamentary schedules have been truncated. But if the government uses the abbreviated time only to push through legislation ? be it the consequential and crucial farm bills or The Industrial Relations Code Bill, 2020, which could water down the rights and protections of workers in small establishments ? giving short shrift to the need to listen to the suggestions of the people?s representatives or answer the Opposition?s questions, it would be reducing the nation?s highest deliberative forum to a mere clearing house. In an unprecedented pandemic, amid an economic downturn like no other, and with a grave face-off with China on the border, this short-circuiting of debate, and denial of the opportunity for MPs and Opposition to have their say, shrinks the possibilities of democracy to find a way out.

Of course, the farm bills do not merit the fears they appear to have stoked. Only the monopoly of the APMCs is sought to be dismantled, not the MSP regime. In any case, amid the pandemic, government will continue to be top procurer of agricultural produce, the bills will only put in place an enabling architecture for a later much-needed reform. This simple message needs to be communicated. But for it to be heard out, the government will first have to show that it is willing to listen.","Bully & Pulpit

15,Farm Bill,"Punjab and Haryana, the breadbaskets of India, took the lead as farmers across the country took the streets on Friday to protest against the Centre's three contentious farm bills, which were recently passed by the Parliament.

As many as 31 farmer organisations, under ageis of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) joined hands for the complete shutdown of Punjab. Among farmers' unions which are supporting the bandh call included Bharti Kisan Union Krantikari, Kirti Kisan Union, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and BKU (Lakhowal).

Farmers at several places in Punjab started gathering at roads for stopping the movement of traffic. Women protesters under the banner of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee in Amritsar took out a protest march. Shops and commercial establishments at many places in Punjab remained shut on Friday morning in the wake of farmers' stir. Shopkeepers had promised to keep their shops shut in support of farmers.

In Punjab, farmers also started a three-day rail blockade against the bills and squatted on tracks at many places.

The protesters have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm reforms would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system and they would be at the ""mercy"" of big corporates. The farmers said they would continue their fight till the three farm bills were revoked.

Farmer groups in Haryana urged residents to observe a bandh from 10 am to 4 pm on Friday. However, the National Highways were exempted from the bandh call. Several organisations in Haryana, including the BKU, also extended support to the nationwide strike called by some farmers' bodies against the bills.

The Delhi-Amritsar highway was blocked at several places by farmers from the BKU and the Revolutionary Marxist Party of India. The Haryana farmers also blocked the Rohtak-Jhajjar road. Protests were also held at several places, including Rewari and Yamunanagar.
  
In National Capital Regoion, hundreds of farmers gathered on a key road in Noida in Uttar Pradesh, prompting deployment of police in riot gear that kept them from proceeding towards Delhi.

The farmers were at the Noida Gate in Sector 14A near Chilla, at the UP-Delhi border, where they were stopped by the Gautam Buddh Nagar police around 12 noon, officials said.

""Today's protest is part of a bigger statewide and nationwide agitation by farmers against the farm-sector-related bills passed in Parliament recently. The farmers are opposed to these 'black laws'. Our demand is that a law should be made that fixes the MSP (minimum support price) as the lowest amount for purchasing crops from farmers,"" BKU's Meerut Zone president Pawan Khatana said.

Elsewhere, farmers in Karnataka staged demonstrations across the state on Friday as part of a 'bandh' call given to protest the 'anti-farmer' policies of the Central and state governments. A large number of ryots from various parts of the state flocked to the state capital to take part in the demonstrations to register their protest against the amendments to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act and the Karnataka Land Reforms Act.

The protesters called these amendments 'anti-farmer' and alleged that some people in power brought them to converttheir black money into white. A group of farmers blocked the busy Tumakuru road near Yashwantpur in the city. Demonstrations were also held in other places, including Mysuru and Davangere.
Opposition backs protests

While the ruling Congress in Punjab and the AAP extended support to the farmers' protest in Punjab, the Shiromani Akali Dal announced road blockades. Punjab CM Amarinder Singh had already promised that and no FIRs would be registered for violation of Section 144, which bars assembly of more than four people.

In Bihar, RJD leader Tejaswi Yadav rode a tractor along with party supporters during 'Bharat Bandh' in Patna. Various Left wing parties too held protests on the roads of Patna. Similar scenes were witnessed in Jharkhand's capital Ranchi as well as Kolkata and Guwahati.
The principal Opposition party, Congress, alleged that the new agriculture laws will ""enslave"" farmers and the MSP will be ""snatched away"" from them.

""A flawed GST destroyed MSMEs. The new agriculture laws will enslave our farmers,"" former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted with the hashtag ""I Support Bharat Bandh"".

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi also hit out at the government, saying the three farm bills brought by it are reminiscent of the ""East India Company rule"".

The MSP (minimum support price) of the farmers will be ""snatched away"" and they will be forced to become slaves of billionaires through contract farming, Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. ""Neither will they get the price nor respect. Farmers will become labourers in their own land,"" she alleged.",Farmers across India rise up against Centre's farm bills; Opposition backs protests,Deccan Chronicle,
16,Farm Bill,"The unity in the House, for once, was admirable but without a sustained campaign on the ground, visuals are futile

In the end, a moral victory is inconsequential, simply because it doesn?t change the facts on the ground. As noted American satirist HL Mencken said, ?In human history, a moral victory is always a disaster, for it debauches and degrades both the victor and the vanquished.? So though, for once, the Opposition seemed to have got its way in meeting the President over the farm Bills and was united against the Government?s gross subversion of parliamentary procedures in rushing through them in the Rajya Sabha by a voice vote despite lacking the numbers, what stops the new laws? The President is not likely to withhold assent or send the Bills back except granting an audience. Even if he were to do so hypothetically, they would be passed again, with or without any amendments, as the ruling BJP has an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha and has already set a precedent of passing debatable Bills by voice vote without discussion, deliberation or consensus. Besides, the President is not bound to act within a time-frame. And the way more Bills were passed even as the entire Opposition stayed away from the House in protest, it looks like the ruling party has no compunction in reducing an august institution to a stamping authority. So Opposition members can speak and cry hoarse all they want but cannot seek solace in parliamentary procedure or vetting by committees to stop motivated laws from being enacted. And when it comes to street fights, last year?s general elections showed us how the members of the grand anti-BJP alliance frittered away their best intentions to their selfish, regional interests. Till that cohesiveness congeals as a single movement, there cannot be any hope for the Opposition.

Worryingly, the Upper House passed three key labour reform bills that ought to have been discussed and debated given their sensitive nature. The Government has enough numbers in the Lok Sabha to override dialogue and even if outnumbered in the Rajya Sabha, it knows it can hijack debate by provoking the Opposition enough and use a voice vote in the resultant din. Or simply take advantage of a boycott. The three Bills relate to new labour codes on industrial relations, social security and occupational safety, all in the name of easing business while diluting workers? rights. Nobody expects the Government to be unreasonably welfarist but in a post-pandemic economy that has witnessed record joblessness, it allows companies with up to 300 workers to fire staff without government permission. The Government, however, feels that this would actually encourage employers to hire more than the previous limit of 100 and, in fact, create jobs. But employers in stressed times are hardly expected to be altruistic and given that our unorganised labourers comprise a big chunk of the country?s workforce, they continue to be exposed to vagaries of market forces. The Rajya Sabha also passed the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020, which ostensibly provides a framework under which organisations in India can receive and utilise grants from foreign sources. This is an umbrella watch on what is unsuitable to this Government the most, namely NGOs, research organisations, think tanks and civil society activists. And the carefully enunciated regulatory mechanism envisaged by the Bill, of course, remains vague about the conditions under which it can be used, lumping them as anything that is detrimental to ?national interest.? Nobody denies the need for greater transparency when it comes to activities sponsored by foreign sources but would that also be used to vet the PM Cares Fund, which is currently exempted under FCRA, or selectively be applied to ?anti-national? NGOs? Or does the Government believe that NGOs shouldn?t exist to point out gaps in its policies and implementation? Besides, most of these organisations have a high record of tax compliances over the years but by making Aadhar and SBI bank accounts mandatory for receipts, the Bill implies tighter controls and increased transaction costs, which are meant to create more impediments. This is just a way to stifle and discourage independent voices than a clean-up as is being proposed. It is the same kind of doublespeak that is latent in the farm Bills. On the face of it, they look reformist, dismantling the heavily cartelised Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and middlemen, and allowing farmers freedom of movement and trade. Question is some of them do not have the investable resources or the expertise for an outreach beyond their geographic limits and would have to depend on ?traders? or the corporations. The smaller and marginal farmers are not literate or educated enough and would not be able to counter the heft of corporations in negotiations and price fixing. In that sense, they could still end up being exploited as before. The farmers fear that in an open, competitive market, they would not get the minimum support price (MSP) that the Government promises to continue and given the diversity and multiplicity of markets, the guaranteed official procurement would be hit over time. Besides, nowhere do the Bills insist on the MSP as a criterion of farm pick-ups by ?traders? and ?sponsors.? They would, therefore, still be in crisis and at the mercy of the dictates of marketers. Besides, the proposed laws are still vague on defining the mechanisms that would replace the regulated economy. This kind of obfuscation has become so familiar that it is in danger of becoming the norm than the exception. And without Question Hour in Parliament, it?s time the questions are asked on the streets. The farmers? ire may just be the beginning of the next electoral plank.",Opp conundrum,The Pioneer,UPA
17,Farm Bill,"On Sunday, the Rajya Sabha passed The Farmers? Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. This newspaper has supported the government?s efforts to bring about a new legislative and policy architecture for agriculture as a method to empower farmers. But as far as legislation is concerned, there is both content and process. And on Sunday, there is little doubt that the process was undermined, reflecting poorly on India?s parliamentary democracy.

The reforms are significant, affecting a range of stakeholders, particularly farmers. They have also generated a political backlash, with even partners in the ruling coalition such as the Shiromani Akali Dal resigning from the Cabinet on the issue. The Opposition was keen on sending the bills to a select committee. Ideally, this should be done ? for the committee process provides an opportunity to examine legislation, refine it, and allows parliamentarians to speak up without being confined to party positions. But if the government was not willing to embark on that process, there should have been a discussion in the House where members got a chance to offer their perspectives and the government listened to feedback and made modifications accordingly. And along with this, there should have been a clear voting process ? a division as it is called in parliamentary parlance ? to get an accurate sense of the mood of the House.

Unfortunately, none of this was done. The discussion in the House was rushed ? since the government wants to push through other legislations quickly, before the session is brought to an early end. And there was no division, but a voice vote ? prompting genuine questions about whether the government had the numbers at all. So it was with one eye on the clock and another eye on the numbers that the government rushed through the process on Sunday ? but this was wrong.

The Opposition was wrong too ? in being disruptive, creating a din, tearing documents, and creating a difficult situation for the presiding officer, perhaps indicating that it too was not confident of the numbers. The responsibility for what happened on Sunday rests with both sides. The government?s victory in getting the bills passed will be tainted by the way it was done, and the Opposition?s response will dilute its legitimate right to protest.",The govt?s rush to pass key farm bills and the Opposition?s conduct were wrong,The Hindustan Times,Neutral
18,Farm Bill,"This is one more instance where the Centre has cocked a snook at the whole concept of cooperative federalism
A furious debate has broken out in the political salons of Delhi, corporate boardrooms and the farmlands of the country over the latest wave of reforms that the Narendra Modi government has unleashed with a stack of legislations that professes to free farmers from the tyranny of over 2,000 corruption-ridden wholesale markets where middlemen have robbed them blind for decades. The three pieces of legislation passed in the Lok Sabha have created a framework designed to usher in contract farming in a big way, catalyse the creation of large cold chain storage facilities and logistic networks, and shake off stockholding restrictions that were designed for an era of shortages. The broad contours of the reforms have a seductive appeal: they will remove the fetters on the farmers by giving them the opportunity to plug into a barrier-free common market for agriculture produce. They will ostensibly allow them to secure a fair price without having to worry about an unsold crop and wastage.

But the big beef over the reforms is that they have been introduced without any consultative process with the states or the various stakeholders. This is one more instance where the Centre has cocked a snook at the whole concept of cooperative federalism. Agriculture is a state subject, and the states have exercised a measure of control over farm supplies. That is now being broken and replaced by a system where the levers of control will pass to large business houses, which can now buy farm produce in bulk directly from the farmers and not worry about any stockholding restrictions. This could have a huge impact on price discovery and it is hard to say just yet whether it will deliver the desired outcomes.

The Centre has tried to sell the idea of reforms by suggesting that the new laws would ensure that farmers will be paid for their produce within three days of the sale ? an assurance that the old mandi system could never provide. But questions have rightly been raised about the inadequacy of the dispute resolution mechanism in protecting farmers? interests in an unequal battle with large corporates. The powers of dispute resolution have been delegated to magistrates and district collectors rather than specially designed agriculture tribunals. There remains a legitimate fear that the entire reform process is a thinly-disguised plan to favour a few crony capitalists while professing to create a brave new world for farmers. The objective is noble and may work in theory but it could well flounder in practice. There is a great danger that New India might be trading in an old, home-grown wheeler-dealer network for a new, swashbuckling bunch of buccaneers, leaving the farmer just as destitute as he is now.",Farms in ferment: Parliament passes farmer bills,The Telegraph,
19,Pradhan Mantri Jandhan Yojna,"In rural areas 44 per cent of the households and in urban areas 33 per cent of them still do not have a bank account.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, a major socio-economic initiative of the National Democratic Alliance government, was announced by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day speech. It is an ambitious attempt at extending formal financial services in a country where only 58.7 per cent of an estimated 24.67 crore households avail themselves of banking services. Despite several steps taken by many governments over the years, financial inclusion has remained elusive. In rural areas 44 per cent of the households and in urban areas 33 per cent of them still do not have a bank account. The NDA government has brought a degree of urgency to the scheme of financial inclusion. A few details of the government?s action plan figured in the budget speech. A Comprehensive Financial Inclusion Plan (CFIP) envisaging coverage of excluded households has been drawn up and is expected to be rolled out under the nomenclature. In its first phase, the Jan-Dhan Yojana will endeavour to provide universal access to all the beneficiaries through sub-service areas (SSA), each of them consisting of 100-150 families in a cluster of villages. Each SSA will be serviced by a business correspondent, who is now being given a pivotal role in facilitating account opening and ensuring smooth bank operations. Unlike in previous action plans, the Jan-Dhan Yojana will have as its focus households rather than geographical areas.

The other important innovation is in extending need-based credit facilities to the new account holders upon their fulfilling certain conditions. A smart card ? the Ru Pay card ? will be issued. Using this it should be possible for customers to operate their accounts without any external help. This would be one of the most visible manifestations of technology as a tool to further inclusion, others being money transfers through mobile telephones, e-KYCs and cash management by banks to extend their services over such wide areas. Insurance companies will be asked to offer micro-finance packages including insurance. Obviously there are major challenges. Even if operational obstacles can be overcome, there is the important question of keeping the first-time bank account holders engaged. Experience suggests that a high proportion of such accounts are hardly used after the initial enthusiasm wears off. The plan of inclusion, which is part of the Prime Minister?s vision of a Digital India, requires all-round support. The government wants to use these accounts for routing cash transfers in lieu of subsidies for essential commodities. Financial inclusion in that sense is therefore much more than extending banking services. Accompanied by an equally ambitious programme of spreading financial literacy, it can achieve many important socio-economic objectives.",An ambitious plan for inclusion,The Hindu,
20,Pradhan Mantri Jandhan Yojna,"Move to increase financial inclusion is welcome. But we need to debate the mechanisms.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an ambitious plan for financial inclusion during his Independence Day speech: the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. The PMJDY intends to provide a bank account, overdraft facility and basic insurance coverage for all households. At present, nearly 40 per cent of the country does not have access to financial services. In this context, moves to increase financial inclusion are welcome. There is, however, a need to debate the mechanisms through which it can be achieved. Access to finance is a service, not a good (bank account). Providing access to financial services may, therefore, require a different approach from, say, providing food items to the poor.

The PMJDY broadly follows the same centrally planned approach to financial inclusion that is practised by the RBI. This approach has not been successful. A recent survey found that nearly half of all business correspondents were untraceable, and 16 per cent of traceable BCs had not conducted any relevant activities. There is, therefore, a need to identify what financial inclusion really means. The central planning model seems to revolve around opening bank accounts. Households, however, have diverse financial portfolios, not all of which can be addressed through providing bank accounts. Payment systems such as Airtel Money and Paypal, for example, address a market demand that bank accounts do not. Similarly, different consumers require different levels of insurance, and for different things. A one-size-fits-all approach through central planning does not address the complex suite of financial services that households require.

In a marked difference from the past, the PMJDY emphatically puts the financial resources of the Central government behind this scheme. The government has also stated that the scheme is intended to aid direct benefits transfers for various social welfare programmes. To fulfil the broader mandate of financial inclusion, however, lessons could be gleaned from the revolution in the telecommunication sector in India, for instance, which did not happen through a mandate driven approach. Initially, call rates were high and access was limited. The natural operation of market forces and the government?s decision to encourage competition allowed for the current levels of mobile penetration. Today, telecom services encompass a complex gamut of services for customers. A similar approach towards financial inclusion is required, and regulators need to move towards a regime of greater competition.",Not just bank accounts,The Indian Express,
21,CAA,"The Centre must stop privileging religious persecution over other forms
As protests continue to ripple in many parts of the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or the CAA, the National Population Register (NPR) and allied issues, their nature, content and direction have drawn critical attention. The introduction of a religious test for Indian citizenship through the CAA evoked widespread public indignation. Right-thinking people from all walks of life mobilised in a manner befitting a vibrant democracy, and several State governments and Assemblies have expressed reservations. Students have been in the forefront of protests that marked an awakening from a defeatist slumber of the country in the face of creeping majoritarianism. As the protests linger on, however, they appear to be sliding into the control of vested interests that work for religious polarisation. The discriminatory CAA targets Muslims, but the protests were driven by the wider civil society at the beginning. Incendiary speeches and slogans at anti-CAA protests, and even support for Islamist politics, have put non-sectarian opponents of the law in a difficult spot. Muslims have equal rights as all other citizens of India to assemble and protest, but reducing the CAA debate into a question of their rights alone is dishonour of the pluralist, inclusive Constitution of secular India. After the success in kindling a national debate on the issue which is now before the Supreme Court that will litigate its constitutionality, anti-CAA protesters must now hold their fire.

The opportunity that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sniffed in the protests is not to reach out and reconcile, but to confront and polarise, particularly in the campaign for the Delhi Assembly election. The chilling effect of the party?s brazen vilification and dehumanisation of the protesters is no longer an abstract fear. Three separate incidents of firing at protesters, two clearly inspired by Hindutva politics, have been reported in Delhi. Far from condemning these incidents in the strongest terms and ensuring swift and strict police action, the BJP leadership has continued with divisive rhetoric. A Union Minister led slogans calling for the ?shooting of traitors?. The BJP must immediately adopt a path of reconciliation and resolution. One way is by making a further amendment to the CAA that will not prioritise religious persecution over other forms of persecution. No protester is against welcoming the persecuted from three neighbouring countries listed in the CAA. By amending the law to remove the arbitrary selection of countries and religious groups, the current turmoil can be easily calmed. A small step of reason and vision will serve India well.",Need of the hour: On CAA protests,The Hindu,
22,CAA,"Amid unending turmoil over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens, Centre has sanctioned funds for the National Population Register exercise with the explicit promise that it is not linked to the divisive NRC. Rhetoric on NRC has been dialled down, but the relief has proved short lived with NPR sparking fresh worries. For one, the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, leave little to imagination that a Population Register could be a precursor to finalising a ?National Register of Indian Citizens?.

Equally alarming are the 2003 rules which allow anyone to raise objections to entries in the ?Local Register of Indian Citizens? at the taluk/ sub-district level. It raises the prospect of genuine citizens in a document-poor country like India being subjected to harassment and witch hunts from neighbours, politically motivated groups, and a dysfunctional lower bureaucracy.

BJP looks out on a limb with this one, as it finds it difficult to convince even its allies, let alone the opposition, that all these enumeration exercises in conjunction with CAA will do more good than harm. Akali Dal now wants Muslim refugees also included in CAA after supporting the legislation in Parliament. Similarly, Assam?s AGP supported CAA in Parliament but is now singing a different tune. Others like JD(U) and BJD, which also supported CAA, are pushing back against NRC. All these parties were mum earlier, despite CAA-NRC?s discriminatory and bureaucratic character as well as NRC?s apparent failure in Assam having been pointed out. While they should have exercised due diligence, BJP should now pay heed and listen to the protesting voices.

But that isn?t happening yet going by Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s rebuke of the violent protests and unqualified backing for UP police. Videos of the violence implicate both sides. With police constraining the space for peaceful protests the danger of grievances manifesting as violence grows. Acts like booking 1,200 people at Aligarh Muslim University for a candlelight protest mustn?t be repeated. 21 shooting deaths in UP alone are excessive. Many states have said they will not cooperate in these enumeration exercises. A gaping trust deficit is accompanying the gathering storm and it portends misery, chaos and economic ruin. Let?s pull back from this chasm, and focus the nation?s attention instead on what the IMF has billed as the surprising magnitude of India?s slowdown. What the country needs is jobs and economic growth, not ?maximum government?.",NPR?s turn: CAA and NRC have created a trust deficit. It?s difficult for NPR to now pass muster,The times of India,
23,CAA,"There are signs of a nationwide outrage building up over Tuesday?s cross-country arrests under the heavy-handed Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act ? generally used for dangerous terrorists ? of five prominent intellectual dissidents, including poets, lawyers who take up the causes of the marginalised, and academics. The challenge to this came swiftly on Wednesday with five prominent academics and human rights advocates moving the Supreme Court against the ?mala fide arrests? that criminalise dissent. The court has ordered only house arrests for now, while the matter is being heard.

There have been strong sectional mobilisations against the government so far ? of farmers, or on the communal question typified by cow vigilante actions and lynch mob attacks. The current mood of popular resentment is different. It?s over trampling of civil liberties by the State as the police dragged out eminent persons from their homes without giving coherent reasons ? pretty much gangster-style.

Those arrested include famous people?s balladeer Varvara Rao, 79, of Hyderabad, and Faridabad-based National Law School (Delhi) visiting professor and human rights and trade union activist Sudha Bhardwaj.

The arrested dissenters, each with a long record of working with the poor, have been labelled ?urban Naxalites? in order to tarnish them, but it?s not clear what the charge against them is. Very loosely, it?s being suggested through friendly TV channels that a plot to assassinate the Prime Minister is being unravelled and ?incriminating ? documents and close surveillance reveal these figures are likely to be associated.

The idea of their association with such a plot, if one exists, sounds preposterous, though not to the Pune police, which picked up the five individuals. Since none has been linked with violence and public disorder in their work going back decades, it?s plausibly being suggested their arrests are an example of the work of the ?thought police?. It?s expected such actions will help keep government critics at bay.

A contrast is being drawn with the way the far-right Sanatan Sanstha ? that was linked to the killings of rationalists like Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare of Pune and journalist Gauri Lankesh of Bengaluru, and at whose premises near Mumbai bombs and firearms were found ? has been treated so far, and the dramatic midnight knock-style arrests of government critics.

A plot against a high dignitary like the PM is a very serious matter and should be painstakingly investigated, and not bandied about on television in order to score political points. The Maharashtra police has failed in this regard. It has linked the eminent dissenters with the material supposedly found in June with another set of prominent dissenters said to be associated with a pro-dalit event in Pune on December 31-January 1. This was organised by Elgar Parishad, founded by retired Supreme Court judge P.B. Sawant. The entire thing seems bizarre.",Arrests of activists totally unjustified,The Asian age,
24,CAA,"The people of India have spoken up ? they will not allow the constitution to be subverted.

For weeks now, Indians have come out on the streets in unprecedented numbers. Not a single protestor is opposed to the grant of citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Instead they have declared in unison that religion cannot be a criterion for the grant of citizenship. Whatever the government says, that is precisely what the Citizenship (Amendment) Act does.

The prime minister has claimed that the National Register of Citizens ? which will divide Indians into ?citizens? and ?doubtful citizens? ? is not even at the discussion stage in official circles. His assurance is completely contradicted by home minister Amit Shah?s statements inside Parliament and outside that the exercise will be rolled out all over the country by 2024. Meanwhile, a renewed push is being made for the National Population Register (NPR), which has no raison d?etre except to serve as a data bank for the NRC.

The issue, however, is not that the two top-most government figures are saying opposing things. Nor should Modi?s word on this be considered final. It is a government?s responsibility to show the country a clear, consistent and consultative legal framework for any policy on this order of significance. Instead it continuously shifts, contradicts, denies its own claims ? broad and detailed ? and has only confirmed popular fears of its bad faith. As a result, only the formal withdrawal of the all-India NRC as a concept can assure the country that this horrendous exercise will not be taken up in the future.

Civil society and the public and large have understood this. That is why the protests have not slowed, and even the violence by the police in different parts of the country ? mainly in BJP-ruled states ? has not deterred citizens from coming out on the streets. Their principal demand is that the CAA be redrafted to offer citizenship to any bona fide refugee facing persecution in India?s neighbourhood. This simple redrafting will adequately cover refugees from the six communities the government says it is concerned about, without gratuitously listing them (and excluding others) in the text of the law. The fact that Modi and Shah are tone deaf to this elementary logic is proof that their aim is to polarise the country on religious lines and drag India further towards a ?Hindu rashtra?.

The illegal manner in which people have been denied the right to peacefully oppose the government?s move ? the misuse of Section 144, detentions and beatings, internet shutdowns ? has widened the ambit of the protests, which are no longer just about the CAA and NRC. In fact, the hundreds of thousands of citizens out on the streets, braving lathis and bullets, chanting slogans and singing songs and vociferously raising their voice against the government, are now fighting for the constitution, for India?s foundational principles, for their democratic rights.

From Assam to Kerala, from Mumbai to Kolkata and in Delhi, Lucknow and Mangalore, Kasargode, Vijayawada and Aurangabad, Indians, young and old, cutting across religion and caste, have come out to let the government know that they will not stay silent in the face of a brazen attempt to ride roughshod over India?s democracy.

For the past six years or so, the country has seen lynchings, rising intolerance and systematic attempts at silencing critics. Institutions of higher learning are under siege. Minority rights are under attack. The completely cynical way in which a long-standing arrangement with Kashmir has been subverted and an entire people suppressed has shocked the conscience of the world. Barring some voices of protest, however, many in India have remained quiet, mostly because they were too scared to speak out.

The CAA-NPR-NRC threat has changed all that. While the BJP privately tells its supporters that this ?trishul? is aimed at Muslims alone, the fact is that millions of Indian citizens are likely to have their lives upended by the party?s insistence that they prove their citizenship. As of today, the government has still not decided what the metric will be, but given bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption and sheer cussedness, ?mistakes? are bound to happen on a large scale. The list of ?doubtful citizens? that this enumerative excess eventually produces will almost entirely comprise the poor. Minorities will be the worst affected, because of the intent behind the exercise, but other marginalised sections will not be far behind.

The Modi government must read the public mood and step back. People do not want vague assurances any more. Nothing short of the complete scrapping of the NPR and NRC and the redrafting of the CAA to bring it in conformity with India?s constitutional principles and international law obligations will do.","The Protests are Not Just Anti-CAA, But Pro-Constitution",The Wire,
25,CAA,"The agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act appears to have gone through three phases. In the first phase, it was a protest against its enactment, as there were genuine apprehensions that the Act, followed by a pan-India NRC exercise, would lead to a large section of society, mostly Muslims, being declared illegal migrants/citizens. There was protests in Jamia Millia Islamia and large-scale demonstrations in Assam and other Northeast states. In the second phase, it became a confrontation between students and the police. Allegations of police high-handedness spread and there were sympathetic protests in educational institutions across the country. The CAA remained the trigger, but it was pushed to the background. Student anger was directed against the police and the government. In the third phase, which we are witnessing today, the movement has been hijacked by political opportunists, separatist factions, fundamentalist groups and lumpen elements. The CAA is an excuse; the target is the ruling party.

The government, in retrospect, appears to have seriously miscalculated the fallout of the CAA. Its success on three fronts appears to have made it insensitive to the simmering anger among the Muslim community. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which banned triple talaq, was a good measure for the emancipation of Muslim women from an atrocious practice, but it antagonised the radical elements. The abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, aggravated the discomfiture of Muslims. Then the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya added to the sense of unease. The canard that the judiciary had been influenced to give the disputed plot to the Hindus for the construction of the Ram temple, with some luminaries writing about the alleged flaws in the judgment, added fuel to the fire. All these three developments ? the annulment of triple talaq, the abrogation of Article 370 and the Ayodhya verdict ? collectively led to a feeling of anger, resentment and frustration among Muslims. The government either was not aware of the depth of Muslim resentment or was not bothered about it and was confident of being able to weather any storm.

The announcement of the National Population Register was unexceptionable, but it was ill-timed. Heavens would not have fallen if it had been delayed by a few months. It has provided further ammunition to the Opposition which has embarked on a disinformation campaign to mislead people.


The police are presently doing a thankless job. If they take action against the agitators, as they did in UP, there are allegations of high-handedness. If they play it safe, as they did in West Bengal, the agitators will have a field day ? destroy railway property, burn buses, attack police posts and indulge in acts of vandalism. It is indeed sad that in most of the states, the governments are not particularly bothered about the destruction of public and private property. The taxpayer?s money is nobody?s concern.

The Supreme Court had, in the context of state governments not taking effective measures to protect public and private property from being damaged by unruly mobs, constituted two committees, one headed by Justice K T Thomas and the other by F S Nariman, to study the problem. The Thomas Committee gave recommendations regarding the modalities for preventive action and for providing sharper teeth to inquiry/investigation. The Nariman Committee made suggestions regarding the assessment of damages. These were accepted by the Court which clearly said that ?the liability will be borne by the actual perpetrators of the crime as well as the organisers of the event giving rise to the liability? and that ?exemplary damages may be awarded?. Uttar Pradesh is perhaps the first state to have shown the political will to punish those who vandalised property.

The agitation has thrown up some disturbing questions. In UP, according to the police chief, there was a conspiracy to create disturbance. If so, one would like to know its full ramifications. Another senior police officer said that the pattern of protests in the state showed guerrilla tactics. The official version that the police did not open fire, and the fact that there have been deaths due to bullet injuries need to be reconciled. Reports about the involvement of Popular Front of India (PFI) in the agitation are a matter of grave concern and require in-depth investigation. The Karnataka home minister, speaking about the Mangaluru violence, stated that the attack on police was premeditated and the arson was orchestrated by anti-social elements. It would appear that the roots of the agitation go much deeper. Resentment against CAA was perhaps the proverbial last straw. But the movement has since degenerated into a confrontation between the government and diverse elements opposed to it.

The objections to the Citizenship Act are generally unconvincing. Assam is the only state which has reasons to feel aggrieved. There is substance in the argument that the Act contravenes Clause 6 of the Assam Accord which guaranteed safeguards to ?protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people?. Reservations on the NRC are understandable. While going ahead with the CAA, the government would do well to scrap the proposal to expand the NRC and explore the possibility of settling refugees in other states across the country which are willing to and in a position to absorb them.",The objections to the Citizenship Act are generally unconvincing,The Indian Express,
26,CAA,"As the year ends, by snatching Jharkhand from the BJP?s command, the Congress is probably having the last laugh. Anti-BJP protests and demonstrations across the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) have certainly punctured the larger-than-life image projected about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It has deflated electorally also in Jharkhand. Hopefully, the Jharkhand results will not make the Congress over-confident about its prospects in the forthcoming Assembly elections, particularly in Delhi. At present, the party needs to pay strategic importance to its anti-BJP campaign even if this demands an alliance with a regional party. Regarding Jharkhand, the Congress acted shrewdly by allying with a regional party prior to the Assembly elections than choosing to deliberate on its options after the declaration of the results. Besides, its protests against the CAA and the NRC has apparently not been ignored by voters.

Amit Shah needs to perhaps deliberate on his confidence about remaining in power for 50 years because of the 2019 parliamentary victory. One needs to view his 50-year ?obsession? from another angle. He may be around, but there is no guarantee that he?d still be in power.

There is also a severe temporal lapse in the BJP?s drafting of the NRC as well as the CAA. The selection of the year 1971 for registering citizens in keeping with the NRC, which has so far not extended beyond Assam, is fairly puzzling. The framers of the NRC presumed that they will take little time in implementing it beyond Assam. India is not Assam, nor is it just Gujarat or Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).

Some importance should also be given to this nation?s functioning in keeping with its Indian Standard Time. Everything does not get done in time here. So, I am wondering, by the time some designated officials land up at the houses of those born before 1971, on the basis of God knows which data, there is no guarantee that those persons would be around. Okay, digital technology is assumed to have made everything a lot faster. But it was not around in the 1970s and earlier. How will midwives (dais) responsible for the birth of many prior to the 1970s be traced? Also, I have not heard of midwives having kept any record of the births they assisted in. With respect to those born in hospitals prior to 1971, the possibility of their certificates being retrieved from there is as good as non-existent. Besides, there is the ?name? issue.

Nowadays, even a minor difference in spelling of names in various identity cards one is supposed to have can spell a major headache. Earlier, usually, only nicknames were decided at the time of birth. The birth certificates of many, if they exist, prior to the 1970s don?t have the same name which was later chosen formally. Most educated and urban Indians are at present loaded with too many identity cards and documents required for verification: Driving license, birth-certificate, educational certificates, passport, PAN card, bank-statement, proof of having paid income tax, voter-ID and of course the Aadhaar card. The last needs to be linked with registered mobile numbers, PAN cards, bank accounts and I am not aware if new rules would include some other documents, including verification by neighbours with documents to prove their identity.

It is really mind-boggling as to how many more identity cards each Indian is likely to be commanded to have. When Aadhaar cards were made compulsory, we ensured that all family members got theirs, by using the services of private agents. Since an elderly member was bedridden, the agent came home for his photograph, fingerprints, etc and his card was made. Earlier, the concerned government unit was approached to facilitate the same service. It took more than a year to respond and got in touch with us after the member had expired. This is just a mild indicator of the lapses still prevalent in the Indian system, because of which it is impossible to expect immediate, accurate as well as complete data to be officially recorded about each and every citizen.

This writer has also learnt of cases of the Aadhaar card displaying the incorrect gender. No person ? male, female, transgender or of any gender ? would like to be identified wrongly, gender-wise. Of course, these errors have been corrected but not instantly or just within a few days.

Even if the present leaders remain confident about the NRC and the CAA being prepared in 50 years, as per IST, why don?t they look into the future; and start keeping records from 2020 than waste money and time in digging up the past?

It may be wiser for the government to give some importance to keeping a record of the blood group of each citizen. It should. It must. This will save time when, God forbid, any person reaches the stage of needing blood supply. Blood group is not decided by race, religion, caste, class and/or any other ethnic division. All my family members have different blood groups. Being accident-prone, they have needed blood more than once. Who knows, which and how many Indian citizens? blood flows through my veins? I just know that it is Indian. Only in films, siblings with the same blood group turn up to save their parent from the jaws of death and thus get reunited.

The unity being voiced by Indians against the CAA and the NRC cannot be taken lightly. It is a wake-up call for all, including ones obsessed by a 50-year syndrome. And this is not a laughing matter.

There are two very conflicting versions of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act movement that are doing the rounds. Both need dispassionate scrutiny if we are to anticipate the future trends in Indian politics.

The first narrative would have us believe that the anti-CAA stir is essentially an uprising of civil society against a bid by the Narendra Modi Government to steer India towards a majoritarian state. According to this point of view, the CAA may seem innocuous at first glance but in effect prepares the groundwork for relegating Muslims to the status of second-class citizens. Although the way this argument has been translated into political messaging in the grassroots would suggest that Indian Muslims must henceforth prove their Indian citizenship with documentation, the more sophisticated of the anti-CAA concede that there is nothing in the laws for the state to undertake such a draconian exercise. Their contention is that it could happen and a pre-emptive strike to negate all discriminatory practices is imperative.

The second feature of this narrative is that the anti-CAA stir is presented as an uprising of civil society and includes a wide cross-section of society. In particular, it is held that students, Dalit organisations and all minority communities are involved in defeating the Modi Government?s project. It is also being held that the CAA is against the tenets of the Constitution and will be struck down by the Supreme Court after the hearings resume in April.

Initially, the parliamentary opposition was slow to react to the CAA. The hearings of the Select Committee weren?t marked by too much acrimony ? although dissenting notes were submitted. The Opposition believed that the main opposition to the CAA would happen in Assam and the North-eastern States and would be linked to the pre-existing disquiet against outsiders and all foreigners ? Hindus and Muslims. The Opposition felt that the real pressure on the Government would come from these areas and that the rest of the country would be largely unaffected. Certainly, there was no anticipation that the Muslim community would react so adversely to a legislation that was aimed at benefitting small communities of refugees. In hindsight, the Opposition has merely piggy-backed on a movement that has been initiated and nurtured by community organisations.

The alternative narrative presented by the Modi Government sees the CAA as attending to a long-standing issue centred on the loose ends of Partition. It has proceeded on the assumption that while illegal immigration from Bangladesh is difficult to contain, the issue would become more manageable and politically rewarding if a distinction could be made between refugees who had fled from religious persecution and those who had entered India for other regions. If the refugees were driven by a push factor, the infiltrators were pulled towards India by economic considerations.

Underlying this distinction between refugees and infiltrators was the unstated conviction that India was the natural homeland for all Hindus. The CAA, in effect, guaranteed a right of return to all Hindus of the subcontinent. Coming to the anti-CAA stir, the Government too was taken by surprise when Muslim protests erupted all over West Bengal on December 13 ? two days after Parliament passed the Bill ? and quickly spread to the Muslim-dominated campuses of Aligarh and Jamia Milia Islamia, Delhi. Hostile demonstrations were anticipated in Assam and the North-eastern States and the Government was prepared to meet these with a combination of persuasion and firmness. There does not appear to have been any corresponding strategy for the protests in the rest of India. Once the protests escalated, the narrative of the BJP and the Government shifted focus to the composition of the protests. The Government was always clear in its mind on two things.

First, that the composition of the demonstrations and the geography of the protests clearly indicated that it was a pre-planned Muslim uprising.

Secondly, it was also felt that the CAA was incidental to the protests. The Muslim community, it was felt, was smarting over the fact that in two successive general elections, the BJP and Narendra Modi had coasted to outright victory without any Muslim support. Modi had not only undermined the political clout of the Muslim community; he had added to the insult by enacting three laws that many Muslims felt were inimical to their community interests. The first was the triple talaq legislation, the first time Muslim personal laws were altered since 1940. The second was the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, a long-standing BJP election commitment that the pundits felt could never be implemented. Thirdly, there was the CAA which clearly distinguished between Hindu refugees and Muslim infiltrators. In principle, by stating that those who were deemed illegal immigrants were ineligible for citizenship, the CAA has left the door open for deportation of foreigners. The CAA also ruled out the possibility of India granting any form of asylum to Muslim Rohingyas fleeing Bangladesh. Finally, the simmering disquiet over the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case was waiting to find an outlet.

The Muslim community, in short, viewed the course of politics since 2014 as a series of defeats. The determination to reacquire political relevance found expression in the anti-CAA stir, aided and abetted by those who had other political scores to settle with the Modi Government.

What is being witnessed in today?s India is a sharply polarised environment based on two very different narratives. India is actually witnessing a sharply ideological division which won?t easily be resolved.  ",CAA protest is Muslims' pent-up ire against Modi,The Pioneer,
28,CAA,"The European Union (EU) Parliament is set to debate a clutch of resolutions on various policies of the Narendra Modi government, ranging from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) to the changes to Article 370. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government?s ideological push has generated domestic challenges, be it in the form of sullen anger among locals in Kashmir or the protests against the CAA. But it has also generated a major international challenge, with criticism about the weakening of democracy in India.

To be sure, the EU Parliament does not reflect the will of the independent, sovereign governments that make up the Union. Additionally, the resolutions and statements by Members of the European Parliament lack any binding authority. It is also true that India?s external adversaries, and ideologically driven groups, have often pushed exaggerated propaganda. And there can be no arguing that the issues that are discussed are India?s business. But the onus rests on Delhi to allay apprehensions. It cannot play up foreign points of view when favourable (remember it invited MEPs to Kashmir), and dismiss them as irrelevant when unfavourable. India needs to restore its image as a healthy democracy, committed to pluralism. Fix the product, and the messaging.",India needs to restore its image as a pluralist democracy,The Hindustan Times,
29,CAA,"The Union law minister has assured the nation that while there is a possibility of the National Register of Citizens being implemented, it would be done on the basis of rules defined after exhaustive consultation. If the sustained protests across the country against the NRC as well as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are any indication, India?s citizens remain deeply suspicious about the real intent of these measures. The contentious nature of the CAA, which seeks to redefine citizenship through a selective filter of faith, is one reason for the public outrage. The mixed signals coming from the top have also helped fan the flames. Earlier, the prime minister had said that talks of a pan-India NRC have not taken place. Narendra Modi, who seemed to be contradicting the views of his colleagues, including the home minister, is now, in turn, being contradicted by the Union law minister. If the claim of talks of a countrywide NRC, as Mr Modi said, is indeed speculative, how is it that the Union law minister spotted the ?possibility? of the NRC being imposed on the nation at some point?

Perhaps this is all a part of the Bharatiya Janata Party?s game plan. A smokescreen, the result of inconsistent pronouncements, is often useful to mask intent. It is the discriminatory nature of the CAA-NRC that makes such subterfuge necessary. The proposal is not just unconstitutional: providing citizenship on the basis of religion goes against constitutional tenets. What is equally objectionable ? this point seems to have got lost amidst the noise ? is that the NRC, the CAA cannot be looked at independently, proposes to shift the burden of proof of citizenship on citizens themselves. Why should Indians, most of whom possess relevant documentary evidence of some form, be made to experience the indignity of having to declare their place in the country to a government that has been elected by them? This is an inversion of the basic contract that binds citizens to their government. Yet, the BJP is convinced that electoral majority has given it the licence to subject the people, rather than its government, to tests of fidelity to citizenship or, as the disastrous demonetization exercise showed, to financial integrity. Ideally, in a democracy, the people are invested with the power to hold the government accountable. But in New India, it is the government that is attempting to render the people powerless in this respect.","NRC, CAA talk all upside down",The Telegraph,
30,Rafale Deal,"The price-redacted audit report on the process to acquire 36 Rafale fighter jets is unlikely to bring closure to the controversy over the deal. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India tabled in Parliament comes in the midst of a vigorous campaign by the Opposition that is questioning the process, based on media revelations about possible lapses and deviations and significant points raised by dissenting members of the Indian Negotiating Team (INT). The Modi government can draw comfort from the fact that the CAG report concludes that the 2016 agreement is slightly better in terms of both pricing and delivery than what was under negotiation in 2007 during the UPA regime. However, the report does not allay all doubts. Pegged at 2.86%, the price advantage in the contract over the 2007 offer is marginal. It is a far cry from the 9% saving claimed by the government. The delivery schedule is only one month sooner than the estimated outer limit in the earlier process. The CAG has found fault with Dassault Aviation being allowed to retain the gains made by the absence of a bank guarantee, which, if executed, would have come with significant charges. Disappointingly, the CAG has not quantified this amount, though it declares that it should have been passed on to the Defence Ministry. The 2007 price offered by Dassault included bank charges, and its absence in the 2016 contract is a clear benefit to the company. In other words, the ?advantage? is lower than the 2.86%.

While the key question of pricing is sought to be resolved by the CAG by comparing the auditors? aligned price with the INT?s computation, some issues remain unaddressed. The original issue of bringing down the total acquisition from 126 to 36 aircraft does not draw much comment. Also, the huge outgo on the India-Specific Enhancements (ISEs), despite the final figure being projected as a 17% saving on the aligned offer, is something that requires deeper examination. While auditing the earlier process, the CAG found that ISEs were upgrades allowed to be made so that Dassault?s bid would be compliant with qualitative requirements. Even a team of Ministry officials that examined in March 2015 the integrity of the earlier process concluded that ?the acceptance of [Dassault?s] additional commercial proposal after bid submission date... was unprecedented and against the canons of financial propriety.? Dassault was not the lowest bidder in the earlier process, and its technical bid had been rejected. Perhaps, this presented an opportunity to the present regime to reopen the entire process to buy Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) and invite fresh bids. However, it chose the IGA route with France, possibly for diplomatic reasons. The CAG identifies as a major problem the fact that the technical requirements are too narrowly defined for most vendors to comply with. The message from the report is that defence acquisition processes require reforms and streamlining.",The CAG report does not allay all doubts about the Rafale deal,The Hindu,
31,Rafale Deal,"With the tabling of the Comptroller and Auditor General?s (CAG) report on the Rafale fighter aircraft deal in Parliament, both BJP and Congress are claiming vindication. While the ruling party is pointing to the report?s finding that the fighter jet deal negotiated by it in 2016 was 2.86% cheaper ? per unit basis ? than the 2007 deal for the same aircraft that was being negotiated by the previous UPA regime, Congress is still hinting at impropriety because the report redacts the actual prices of the aircraft and associated components.

In fact, CAG itself finds comparing the two deals ? UPA?s 126 aircraft and NDA?s 36 aircraft ? quite challenging. Not only were the quantities different, the auditor also had to factor in price escalation over the intervening years as well as differences in the packages themselves. UPA?s 126 aircraft deal had a significant transfer-of-technology component unlike NDA?s 36 aircraft in flyaway condition. Nonetheless, the CAG report lays out the reasons for the cancellation of the UPA deal as Rafale?s French manufacturer Dassault Aviation refusing to provide guarantee for the aircraft that were to be produced by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and failure to determine the manpower cost of manufacturing in India. This setback after a 15-year procurement process had created a real crisis for the Indian Air Force whose fighter squadrons are fast depleting.

But BJP may have scored a self-goal when it declared after coming to power that it would get a better fighter aircraft deal. As the CAG report shows, three items of the new Rafale deal including the basic aircraft were procured at the same price as the old deal. It also indicates that the marginal price drop overall happened at the cost of removal of banking and performance guarantees, a standard feature of such contracts. Congress is bound to play this up, and political fisticuffs will continue.

On several matters, the Narendra Modi government has failed to answer the opposition?s questions clearly and unequivocally. To cite one of very many, why can?t the price of the Rafale jet be revealed to a select parliamentary panel, especially as estimates are widely available and cannot be tough to find out for anyone determined to dig? Opacity in the government?s arguments has enabled the opposition to look for advantage. Finally, if this is the tortuous path that every defence procurement has to take, it is a tragedy. A better defence procurement process needs to be worked out expeditiously for the sake of national security.","CAG?s Rafale report: Political fisticuffs will continue, India?s defence procurement is in a mess",The times of India,
32,Rafale Deal,"The report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) on the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France ? which has become a matter of deep controversy ? doesn?t provide satisfaction on points of discord. There can be little doubt that the CAG will need to expand its present effort to be more comprehensive if its work is to carry conviction. This should ideally happen before the next Parliament has a chance to debate its report. The report, presented to Parliament on Wednesday, fails to shed light on some key questions, first raised by Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who made serious allegations that were amplified by carefully documented and well-sourced reports in the media along with defence ministry documents.

The CAG report makes two principal assertions. The first is that the price contracted by the present government to buy 36 Rafale jets is 2.86 per cent cheaper than that negotiated to buy 136 of the same aircraft by the UPA government earlier. The basis for the calculation is not presented as the CAG has excised the price data. However, a media report by a credible defence analyst relying on sources involved in the negotiations suggests the price offered by Dassault Aviation in 2016 for 36 aircraft was 40 per cent higher than its offer in 2012 for 126 aircraft.  The package cost was 19.5 billion euros in 2012, and this included the cost of aircraft, technology transfer (to HAL, the then Indian partner), India-specific enhancements, weapons systems on board, spares and maintenance guarantees. This works out to Rs 1,000 crores per aircraft. In contrast, the 2016 price was Rs 1,600 crores per aircraft.

 

The second key point made by the CAG is that the delivery schedule offered in 2016 was five months quicker than the one proposed in 2012. For scrapping the UPA-era negotiations and signing a fresh contract by jettisoning HAL and introducing a practically-bankrupt Indian businessman into the proceedings, the Narendra Modi government cited the reasons of better price and faster delivery (to bolster security needs). But the CAG itself casts doubts on the government?s claimed five-month time advantage. It also criticises the government for not going for a fixed price formula, a point also made in a strong dissent note by the three ?domain experts? in the Indian negotiating team, and accepting the French formula of price escalation instead. To be comprehensive, the CAG should have referenced the dissent note, which carries multi-dimensional insights. The CAG report will also be found wanting for not alluding to the gross violation of Defence Purchase Procedure 2013 and 2016, which resulted in the PMO conducting ?parallel negotiations?, undercutting the official Indian negotiators, a point made by the then defence secretary in a note to then defence minister Manohar Parrkiar, allowing scope for possible legal action.",CAG?s Rafale report raises many questions,The Asian age,
33,Rafale Deal,"Examining the process of decision-making in a government involves ferreting out information, documents that need to be brought out from the dark, into the light, in public interest. This was true in the 1980s of Bofors, about kickbacks in a defence deal. Even governments have realised that records which are meant to be confidential are invaluable in bringing illegality to book. More recently, in 2016, the Panama Papers, the painstaking unveiling of offshore transactions in tax havens, resulted in hundreds of crores of undeclared assets being traced by the government. Now, in the Rafale case, for Attorney General KK Venugopal to raise an objection in court seeking dismissal of the review petitions on the ground that they cited documents ?stolen? from the defence ministry, for him to attempt to wield the Official Secrets Act as a shield against allegations of wrongdoing in the 2016 aircraft deal between India and France, is disappointing ? and outrageous. The question is not just, as the Chief Justice of India-led bench put it: What had the government done till now? After all, the first newspaper report, which the AG claims is based on stolen documents, was published a month ago, on February 8 in The Hindu. In her reply to the allegations against the government on the Rafale deal in Parliament, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not speak about a theft. The question, more importantly, is one that the bench also asked: ?Suppose there is a corruption complaint, are you going to shelve it under national security?? Is there a liberty to commit corruption??

The attempt to target the messenger and to criminalise the whistleblower, all under cover of ?national security? or ?stability? of government or ?official secrecy?, is an attack on the freedom of expression and the people?s right to know. What falls under the Official Secrets Act in a democracy is something that needs constant contest, the need for official secrecy has to be weighed against the citizen?s right to know. For, the same statute book that has the OSA gives pride of place to the Act that empowers citizens to access, and to demand, information under the control of public authorities in order to promote transparency. In any conflict between the two, in a democracy that calls itself open, surely the letter ? and spirit ? of the right to freedom of speech and expression and information should trump the archaic and increasingly anachronistic OSA. Notably, the Supreme Court has recognised this democratic imperative. Over the years, India?s apex court has enlivened and expanded the protections accorded to the whistleblower, to ensure that those who expose corruption and wrongdoing are not vulnerable to bullying and intimidation.

If AG Venugopal?s objection in court on Wednesday were to be taken seriously, if it were to be dignified by the court, it could be a chilling message that would strike at the heart of a free press. It would protect the wrongdoers in the dark. The court must, as it has in the past, uphold the way of the open democracy.",Stealing the facts,The Indian Express,
34,Rafale Deal,"The Supreme Court has prodded the Centre again on the controversial Rafale fighter purchase terms. Earlier court directions had to do with the selection process, but more searching questions are now being asked, mainly on two issues: pricing and the offset deal between Dassault and an Indian private player. The government might take cover under the Officials Secrets Act on not disclosing the pricing of a deal already being fulfilled by India with the first payment made to Dassault. It would, however, be in everyone?s interest for the Centre to be more forthcoming on the deal than it has been ? in Parliament and in the Supreme Court. Perhaps it?s too late to take the major Opposition leaders into confidence on the deal?s broader aspects.

There?s never been any doubt on the Rafale?s quality and weapon capabilities. But public money is being spent and questions will be asked. It?s up to the government to satisfy those who want to know more about the new deal, after the deal envisaged by the UPA government was altered. Also, India has a right to know if a bribe or unfair commission was built into the deal as a not so well-equipped private player, with little previous history of defence manufacturing, is among many with offset deals that will see money ploughed back into making parts and subsidiary systems in India. While disclosures may be a concern over the nature of tactical weaponry being revealed if the pricing details were to be made public, there is little need not to be forthcoming on the offset deals if suspicions are to be cleared.",Rafale deal: Come clean,Deccan Chronicle,
35,Rafale Deal,"Win-win deal for India-France collaboration

Almost a year after Prime Minister Narenda Modi announced India would purchase 36 ready-to-use Rafale fighter planes from France, India and France have inked an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) to formalise the announcement. This is the first fighter aircraft deal India has finalised since the 1990s, when the Russian Sukhois were purchased. While it paves the way to add teeth to the Indian Air Force, which is battling a shortage of fighter squadrons, the deal also strengthens bilateral cooperation between the two countries in defence matters straddling the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. India is already heavily invested with France in military equipment, including the Scorpene submarines which have come under a cloud after critical data was leaked to a foreign publication. While investigations are on regarding the breach, the incident is unlikely to impact India-France ties. The Indian Navy was quick to say that Project

75-I, of which the Scorpene class submarine is a part, will proceed once a strategic partnership model is put in place. There had been two major concerns critics of the Rafale deal had flagged. The first related to the high cost, both hidden and open. And the second was about the very capability of the fighter jet manufactured by Dassault Aviation. Tough bargaining over the last year from the Indian side and the French Government's willingness to accommodate New Delhi's viewpoint, have resulted in a saving of nearly 750 million euros for India, when compared to the arrangement that had been worked by the previous UPA regime. The aircraft deal is now worth 7.87 billion euros. Additionally, there is a 50 per cent offset clause that mandates the French company to invest half the contracted amount in India. This will create employment opportunities at home and add to skill development. There is also a penalty clause that India can invoke in case of Dassault's failure to meet stipulated obligations. The cost would have been even lower than the roughly Rs 1,640 crore per aircraft, but for India's insistence on tweaking the specifications to meet its needs ? such as the ?cold start' system for the plane to operate efficiently at high altitude. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar's earlier remark that he was a ?tough negotiator? was not, after all, an empty boast.

As regards Rafale's cutting-edge capabilities, there was never any doubt, though some experts, while making comparisons with similar Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), believed otherwise. The Rafale is ahead of the F-16 planes being used in various parts of the world and is comparable to the American fifth-generation F-35. Besides, it's way ahead of the Su-30 that India has as its answer to the F-16. It can perform air defence and ground attacks simultaneously, with a combat range of 780 km to 1,500 km; carry more than nine tones of weapons, including nuclear arsenal; and use its precision-guided missile systems to hit targets at a range of 300 km. 

It may be a coincidence, but the agreement comes at a time of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan and China's insistence on backing this sponsor of terror. It always helps to fortify one's defence capabilities when one has a hostile neighbour on the one hand and a slippery one, on the other.",The Rafale advantage,The Pioneer,
36,Rafale Deal,"There?s no such thing as a benign Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report. The government?s auditor is expected to be finicky and puritanical when it comes to processes and finances ? and it is usually that. The report by CAG on the Indian Air Force?s acquisitions that was tabled in Parliament on February 13, is just that, although not in a way that either the government or the opposition would want. The report is on 11 air force purchases, although much of the focus has been on one deal ? the purchase of 36 Rafale fighters through an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) between India and France.

At one level, the report on Rafale, is a vindication of the government?s stance that it bought the aircraft at a lower price than in an older deal negotiated by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), and scrapped in March 2015. At another, by highlighting the absence, in the new deal, of financial and performance guarantees on around 25% of the cost of the old deal, the government?s auditor has explicitly articulated its point of view that Rafale maker Dassault Aviation has saved some amount of money and not passed it on to the government of India. This, the fact that the offsets part of the deal will only be dealt with in a subsequent report, and the report?s mere restatement of the government?s position on the lack of financial and performance guarantees in the new deal will likely provide enough material for the Congress and other parties to continue to ask questions about the deal. The big message in the CAG report, though, isn?t any of this. Anyone reading the report cannot but be appalled at the way the defence procurement process works in India. It is, at best, inefficient, and at worst, opaque.

Sample this: the government spent four years, between 2000, when it first set out to buy the much-needed fighter jets, and 2004, deciding whether the purchase should be done on a so-called single-source basis or through a competitive bid. The government in charge was the first edition of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Or this: in November 2004, having decided to opt for the competitive bidding route, the government put out a Request for Interest. The CAG report says the only thing this contributed to the process was a delay. Sure enough, the Request for Quotations didn?t go out till August 2007. The government of the day? The first edition of the UPA. The bureaucracy and the defence establishment seem to have done their bit too. The CAG report is especially harsh on the narrow definition of Air Staff Qualitative Standards or ASQRs, and the arrival of the benchmark price, which seems to be without basis ? a committee under UPA-1 came up with a price 47% lower than the lowest bid in the case of the old deal; the Indian negotiation team for the IGA under the NDA, started with one that was 57% lower. The CAG terms both prices unrealistic.

In what must cause discomfort to the UPA, the report says Dassault was treated preferentially in the old deal. Indeed, the fighter didn?t meet nine of the ASQRs; the company was allowed to change its technology and price bid. CAG also says a competing bid from the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) was also non-compliant. Interestingly, after the deal was all but done, in June 2012, the then defence minister asked for an overview of the entire process. By the time this overview was complete, the government had changed. This overview, results of which were submitted in March 2015, found bids of both Dassault and EADS non-compliant and recommended that the process be restarted.

And so, 15 years after the process began, India found itself at the starting point again. A reading of the CAG report shows that this isn?t unique to the fighter deal. It mentions a 2012 acquisition of 11 Doppler Radars by the Air Force, which took 96 months, and points out that the India Meteorological Department, also a government department, took a mere 11 months to acquire the same equipment. Irrespective of what their positions may be on the Rafale deal, the government and the opposition need to agree that the defence acquisition process needs an overhaul. The new government (whichever one) that takes over in May would do well to set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee to do this.",CAG report on Rafale highlights the flawed process,The Hindustan Times,
37,Rafale Deal,"When an institution that believes in hi-tech surveillance of ordinary citizens fails to prevent some of its most precious documents from being stolen, it is the stuff of pure comedy. Only when that institution is the government of a country, it is no longer comic but dangerous. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre has declared that crucial documents relating to the Rafale deal have been stolen. The dangers this implies are multiple. The disconnect is dizzying: while the ministry of home affairs empowers Central agencies to snoop on citizens? computers to stop crime and terrorism, the defence ministry is blind to the thieves in its midst. While the BJP?s minions seize ?anti-nationals? and mobs kill people from minority groups in the name of cow protection while beating up Kashmiris on the side, a targeted little burglary is executed in the building that houses the defence and foreign ministries and the Prime Minister?s Office. This argues incompetence of such gigantic proportions that comedy vanishes. It must have been this incompetence that allowed a private vehicle loaded with explosives to destroy a truck full of jawans amid a military convoy on a highly protected route. It is the same incompetence, this time in propaganda, that has ministers and officials scrambling to reach an agreement on the number of dead militants in Balakot.

There is, shamefully enough, another side to the government?s declaration. The allegedly stolen papers were used by a newspaper to expose dubious aspects of the Rafale deal. The government appears unable to conceal its anxiety that these documents might be used as evidence in court. Perhaps it hopes that if they have been stolen ? a charge not made when the newspaper used them ? their ?unclean? source may discredit them as evidence. To distract attention from a mess that is obviously far from simple, the government, through its mouthpiece in court, is talking of the newspaper?s supposed violation of the Official Secrets Act. Wielding laws is the easy way out. More dangerous, however, is the Narendra Modi-led government?s attitude towards journalism. Independent thinking, analysis, criticism and pursuit of truth for public interest are simply impermissible.

38,Hathras Rape Case,"The Yogi regime is trying to stigmatise legitimate outcry on the Hathras murder
The registration of multiple police cases in Uttar Pradesh on charges of conspiracy and sedition is an insensitive, albeit unsurprising, response to the legitimate outrage sparked by the way in which its officials had handled the aftermath of the gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl in Hathras. The State administration is seeking to convert the outcry and political advocacy into a putative conspiracy to foment caste discord. There seems to be inadequate recognition that initial attempts to deny that any rape took place and to prevent political leaders and the media from meeting the girl?s family pointed to an administrative posture hostile to the doing of complete justice. It was only to be expected that such an attitude would create a backlash against the State government. The only way to restore its image is to display empathy for the victim and treat protests seeking justice as legitimate. Even though the suspects named by the 19-year-old before her death in a Delhi hospital have been arrested and the FIR includes the charge of gang rape, there are clear signs that the Yogi Adityanath government is adopting dubious tactics to prevent what it sees as the crystallisation of public opinion against itself. Recognising that the formation of an SIT did not help undo the damage to the government?s image, the Chief Minister recommended a CBI investigation. However, even that came across as a move to fob off any adverse order from the Allahabad High Court, which has taken suo motu cognisance of the matter.

Remarks by senior police officers to the effect that there was no evidence of rape ? citing the absence of semen in swabs taken for forensic analysis ? indicated an official reluctance to acknowledge the gang-rape part of the offence. Latest reports suggest that a journalist on his way to Hathras and three others have been detained. They are also sought to be linked to the Popular Front of India, an organisation whose name came up in connection with recent riots and anti-government protests. This raises the suspicion of an attempt to control the narrative by resorting to a template of identifying members of a communal organisation as alleged conspirators and instigators of violence. The template includes the use of penal provisions relating to sedition and conspiracy and the projection of a theory that all protests and political activity against it constitute a plot to overthrow the government. A responsive government would have endeavoured to extend a healing touch, reassure the victims, and reserve its wrath for the offenders. Instead, the Adityanath government is focusing on blaming political leaders, pressuring the victim?s family and preventing the emergence of a united voice against sexual violence, attacks on the marginalised communities and the devastating effect an unregenerate caste hierarchy has on society.",Grapes of wrath: On Yogi Adityanath regime handling Hathras case,The Hindu,

Police hurriedly set the pyre alight under cover of night, without allowing the family to properly mourn their dear one or conduct customary last rites.

Now an entire district is under Section 144 CrPC to quell protests and prevent politicians from meeting the family. A police cordon ran around the village to keep the family out of the media. A viral video of Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar talking down to the Dalit family, warning of harm to their credibility, is in fact a body blow to the government?s credibility. It lends credence to the family?s claims of threats from the administration.

The victim?s mother purportedly found her brutalised body without clothes on. A professional police force would have proceeded to verify rape. But analysis of samples happened 11 days after hospitalisation and no semen was detected. Government?s own guidelines rule out the likelihood of finding such evidence after 72-96 hours of rape. This helps the police and accused build a case for undermining the gangrape charge despite the victim?s dying declaration. With rank incompetence and apathy to answer for, officials are taking cover under threat to public order. Throttling dissent in this manner isn?t going to help. BJP must remember that the Nirbhaya case punctured UPA-2 and Sheila Dikshit. No civilised society can tolerate in silence and without protest the brutalisation inflicted on the 19-year-old, the botched investigation or the indignities heaped upon the hapless Dalit family. The Adityanath government must correct policing failures for people?s as well as its own sake.",Dalit Nirbhaya: The state?s apathy just keeps getting worse,The times of India,
40,Hathras Rape Case,"All states have information departments to put out the official line on any given subject. But in ?atmanirbhar? Uttar Pradesh has the government felt the need to hire the services of a PR firm to press its controversial claim that the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was gang-raped last month in Hathras and succumbed to her injuries on September 29 was not actually raped at all.

On Thursday night, a number of foreign correspondents in India ? and some national media correspondents ? received a ?clarification note? from Concept PR, a Mumbai-based public relations firm with the ungrammatic headline:

?Hathras girl was not rape, reveal Forensic investigation, Preliminary Medical and Post-mortem report?

The note played up other claims too, such as:

?The reports also revealed the conspiracy to push the state into caste turmoil?


?SIT is sure to unveil evil design behind the whole incident?

Prasar Bharati Cuts Ties With PTI, Says it Will Invite Bids from 'Domestic News Agencies'
And in a presumed reference to the government?s decision to quickly cremate the victim?s body in the middle of the night against the wishes of her family, the note says:

Police action was prompt to prevent untoward incident: further intensive probe into the matter

The PR note then goes on to reiterate what the UP assistant director general (ADG) of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar had already told the Indian media:

?Putting to rest all the speculation, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report on the vaginal sample of the 19-year-old girl of Hathras has revealed that she was not raped. This is the conclusive confirmatory report after the post mortem medical report and post mortem report both have concluded that no rape was committed.?

While the UP government?s claim that the ?Hatras girl was not rape(d)? has been questioned by medical and legal experts who say the state?s police evidently do not understand the definition of rape in the Indian Penal Code or the basics of rape forensics, the PR note makes it clear that the ongoing investigation is going to focus less on the Hathras crime and its perpetrators and more on the alleged ?conspiracy to push the state into caste turmoil? which the ADG says the forensic report had ?exposed?.

The ?clarification note? also specifies that the Special Investigation Team assigned by chief minister Adityanath to look into the matter ?is sure to unveil evil designs of vested interests who wanted to create an atmosphere of disharmony in Uttar Pradesh.?

The UP Police will ?now probe as to who was responsible for this malafide campaign and twisted the facts despite the statements of the responsible officers otherwise?.

This particular mention in the press note should be read as a warning to domestic media houses which have reported the Hathras incident as a gang-rape, quoting the family, or would still follow up on the story as so ? besides sending out a caution to foreign correspondents to stay away from it.

The wider message also appears to be that in ?New India? rapes don?t take place, certainly none that reflect the harsh reality of caste injustices. And that any global attention on this case ? akin to the Nirbhaya rape case of 2012 when the Congress-led UPA was in power ? will not be acceptable. If anything, global media coverage would likely be looked upon by the government as part of a ?conspiracy?, an ?evil design? against UP and india.

This PR move was likely prompted by the fact that the rape victim?s death hit the headlines in several international papers, including the New York Times and the Guardian. The Adityanath government urgently needed a media strategy to nip this coverage in the bud, and also give some ammunition to the BJP?s NRI supporters to defend the party on social media and elsewhere.",Yogi Govt Enlists PR Firm to Push ?Hathras Girl Was Not Raped? Story Line With Foreign Media,The Wire,
41,Hathras Rape Case,"What makes a powerful government so insecure that it must build a wall of policemen to barricade from public view ? and cut off access to ? a village in which a traumatised Dalit family grieves the death of a 19-year-old daughter brutalised by upper caste men? That question is answered in the heavy-handedness of the Uttar Pradesh government of Yogi Adityanath as it clumsily tries to brush, under countless carpets, its callousness and ineptitude. The crime in Hathras was heinous. But what has followed in its wake, the hurried cremation by the police in the dark, the denial of the family?s right to perform the last rites, followed by boorish police action to prevent anyone, including Opposition leaders of the Congress and TMC, from reaching the young woman?s family, has added up to a sordid spectacle that should deeply embarrass the Yogi Adityanath regime in UP. Reassuringly, the court has stepped in to restore a semblance of civility, uphold the law. Taking suo motu cognisance of incidents that have ?shocked our conscience?, and calling it a matter of ?immense public importance and public interest?, the Allahabad High Court has promised to look into allegations of ?violation of the basic human and fundamental rights not only of the deceased victim but also of her family members?.

It remains to be seen if the court?s rightful outrage, and mounting public indignation, are successful in making a dent in a wider culture of impunity that appears to be deepening in UP. The police?s grave missteps in Hathras have been preceded by a series of warning signals. The number of encounters grows in the state ? 115 at last count ? even as there is no action against any policeman for the extrajudicial killings. They receive political sanction, in fact, from the ruling party. Two police officials have been chargesheeted in the Vikas Dubey case ? featuring the gangster in whose rise and death the police evidently played a dubious role. Three police officials stand chargesheeted by the CBI in the Unnao rape case of 2017. The lines between those whose responsibility it is to uphold the law and those who break it have been blurring dangerously in UP. Here, the police routinely invites allegations of conducting itself as an arm of the ruling party, not the state. And of standing with the powerful and targeting the vulnerable who most need protection of the law ? those who belong to a lower caste or class, a minority religion, or take a dissenting political position.

The Hathras case is a test for the UP Police, and also for the Yogi Adityanath government that it reports to. All of the government?s determined efforts to project and promote UP as a well governed state will amount to naught if it is unable to send out a simple message ? that it is fully committed to upholding the law and bringing to book those who think they can brutalise a woman and get away with it.","Barricading the village of a grieving family shows how insecure the UP government is, and how compromised its police.",The Indian Express,
42,Hathras Rape Case,"On a day that governments and government servants are called upon to renew their commitment to peace and the nation?s progress, rising caste crimes and back-to-back rapes ? in Hathras, Bulandshahr, Azamgarh, Balarampur and now Bhadohi ? have together come as a terrible reflection on governance, law and order, and society.

Amid the resulting outrage and claims ? of police destroying evidence in Hathras and Balarampur in order to hasten the closure of the particular cases ? Smriti Irani?s praise at the UN of Indian laws as ?strong enablers? of women does not sound credible.

Save for the Prime Minister ? who issued a call in general terms for ?strict action? in the case ? there has not been a single statement from the home minister ? who is set to resume political work in poll-bound West Bengal ? or from any women leaders in the government.

When the erstwhile government, which returned to power in 2019, said Beti Bachao, it was perhaps not a slogan. It was a warning.

Following the controversial midnight cremation of the Hathras rape victim against the wishes of her family, the UP police is claiming that she had not been raped and that the matter is being ?twisted? to ?stir caste tension?.

Even while the specific nature of the offence remains moot following the stealthy cremation precluding a second autopsy, how does this glib desexualisation of the crime lessen its severity ? the victim had been permanently disabled ? or its essential egregiousness?

Also pertinently, how does this ? or theories of a dispute over cleaning a drain ? show that it is not a caste crime, rather than prove it otherwise?

A relative has reported being told by police that there was no monetary relief to be given to the family after the death of its prospective earning member who contributed valuable labour.

But should a caste atrocity be proved to have been committed on the girl, her kin are entitled to full compensation under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

This sly spin doctoring by police of the case thus only goes to lay bare their sexist mindset ? the fact that they did not value her life and its promise ? as well as their bad work ethic ? of staying on the right side of the local caste dynamic and protecting their jobs instead of serving the citizen.

New NCRB crime data reports 59,853 crimes against women from UP in 2019, the highest among states. This includes not only rapes, but also dowry deaths, crimes against a minor, domestic abuse and so on. Rights denials, which lie at the core and crux of all these offences, are no doubt outside the ambit of this classification.

However, rape also being a caste crime, data shows that nine states in India, including Uttar Pradesh, accounted for 84 per cent of all crimes against dalits the same year; yet the conviction rate of offences under the Atrocities Act was only 32 per cent, with the pendency rate an alarming 94 per cent. Hate crimes against dalits went up by seven per cent in 2019.

The ruling party at the Centre and the state has accused the Opposition of playing politics in Hathras.

But what else is the Opposition supposed to do in the face of such blatant condoning of criminality as we witness in case after case?

Nevertheless, as members of the victim?s family continue to remain in effective house arrest, the borders of Hathras district have been sealed, Section 144 of the CrPC imposed for a month, and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi detained and roughed up by police on their way to the victim?s home.

Taking suo motu cognisance of the case, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court issued notices to the Uttar Pradesh government.

43,Hathras Rape Case,"Dalit girl from Hathras dies after being brutally gang-raped. Where are the deterrent laws and action? Will we have to wait years again?

The ?Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao? campaign is being slandered with each passing day as it becomes a ?Beti Hatao, Beti Darao? mission in reality, with heinous crimes against the girl child and women going up every day across the country. So it is that just two days after Daughter?s Day, a 19-year-old Dalit girl was brutally gang-raped in Uttar Pradesh?s Hathras district. In a chilling throwback to the Nirbhaya case and the incident in Hyderabad not so long ago, the girl was left with her tongue cut out, ostensibly to prevent her from testifying. Her legs were bruised so severely and her spine was so lethally battered that she was completely paralysed while her arms could just about register a movement. Still she fought for her dear life over 15 days in hospital but gave up despite being brought to Delhi?s AIIMS. Yet there was no outcry for the last fortnight till she became just another cold statistic. Nobody mourned a young life snuffed out in its prime due to caste-based hatred, sexual depravity and a deteriorating law and order situation, particularly in the Hindi heartland. Exacerbating the situation, as usual, were the poorly conducted investigations and a slow justice system. The conviction rate for rape is only 27.2 per cent despite the fact that it accounts for 11.5 per cent of the total crime statistics. On an average, 91 rapes were reported every single day across India in 2018, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. The Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) says that trial in rape cases should be completed in 60 days but that never happens because of the tardiness of police investigations. Then there are judicial flaws that need to be plugged when it comes to rape, the primary being bail to the accused, which should be denied till the probe is completed. Some independent studies indicate that the average time of finishing trial even in fast track courts is eight months. And even if one were to get death penalty, acquittals, appeals and mercy petitions mean that only about five per cent death penalties are actually upheld by the Supreme Court. A traumatised rape survivor hardly has the courage to go through such travesty and gives up midway. The 2012 Nirbhaya rape, which shook the conscience of not just the nation but the world, too, compelled our parliamentarians to strengthen the punitive justice delivery system based on the recommendations of a committee that included eminent jurists. It led to some crucial amendments to the law, which included changing the very definition of ?rape?, the establishment of fast-track courts to ensure victims get justice without undue delay, harsher punishments for the accused with the provision of death sentence being added to it and the abolition of the two-finger test among others. Two other such incidents, in Kathua and Unnao, where two children were raped, had widened the scope of punishment for raping a child under 12 to death penalty. Undoubtedly, there has been an increase in reportage of crimes against women after Nirbhaya though much of them are still under-reported. Besides, as the Hyderabad incident has shown, question marks remain on the use of the death penalty as criminals are now murdering their victims to destroy evidence. For the criminal, there is no deterrent. But yes, he can be stalled if deterrence is built into the system by fast-tracking procedures and ensuring swift justice. Conviction rates need to go up proportionately. At present, fast-track courts are no different from the usual courts in terms of case pile-ups and vacancies. A quick, fair and unbiased judicial set-up with requisite number of judges is a sine qua non. A continuously responsive system is a bigger deterrent than one or two landmark rulings.

The unchecked crimes against women and the girl child are also skewering gender equity in the rural hinterland. According to a study supported by the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), that was conducted in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the increasing crimes against women have deepened preferences for a son. So much so that we have lost around 4,60,000 girls to sex selection at birth each year between 2013 and 2017, according to the UNFPA. When errants go scot-free and the woman?s family is left to wallow in pain and shame, a malaise becomes a societal archetype. And the girl child will continue to be vulnerable, either used as a tool in a caste war as the rapists in Hathras belonged to the upper caste, a sacrifice in a revenge drama or a family feud or a life cheap enough to be pawned by male-dominated codes. Predictably, there is a political slugfest over this latest incident, with the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) slamming the BJP Government in UP for the sorry plight of law and order in the State. Their protests will once again be tainted by the ruling party as ?crocodile tears? and a ?political conspiracy? to ?defame the Government.? The Opposition will predictably make the rape a subset of excesses on Dalits. But neither the Opposition nor the ruling party was there for the girl when she was writhing in hospital for a fortnight. And much to the shame of India?s most populous State, nobody wants to roll back UP?s unique distinction of reporting the highest crime spiral against women. As for justice, will we have to wait another seven years?",Another silent Nirbhaya,The Pioneer,
44,Hathras Rape Case,"There is now a growing opinion ? including among some in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ? that the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has handled the Hathras case poorly. This could be due to political patronage to members of a caste group deemed loyal; it could be due to administrative incompetence; it could be due to the patriarchal mindset that governs both social and institutional attitudes towards women; it could be due to the prejudice with which Dalits are viewed in this country; or it could be due to all these factors.

What the UP government needed to do was ensure correctives ? both in the immediate context to hold perpetrators as well as administrative officials in Hathras accountable and in the medium-term by instituting structural reforms in the criminal justice system and its intersection with political power.

Instead, it has decided to order a probe into an ?international? conspiracy and plot to defame the Yogi Adityanath government and foment caste violence. The UP police has also filed 19 FIRs against both named and unnamed individuals on charges ranging from sedition to promoting enmity between castes and communities. This is outrageous. The outcry against the injustice in Hathras was because citizens were shaken and angry and wanted action. Not only did the UP government fail in its task of protecting the life, liberty and dignity of a young Dalit woman, it first sought to cover up the incident and is now using the controversy to attack critics and construct conspiracy theories, invoking the proverbial foreign hand. The state should stop looking outside, and look within its own administration. That is where the fault lies.","Hathras: UP is on the wrong track, again",The Hindustan Times,
45,Hathras Rape Case,"Anti-national? elements, funded by foreigners, and the Opposition are going all out to hurt the image of the Yogi Adityanath government supposedly reputed for its excellent law and order
There it is ? the ?foreign hand?. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister has ordered an investigation into what he says is an international plot by groups and individuals overseas to create caste-based conflict in his state. This is the most imaginative defence to have been thought up to discredit the countrywide protests against administrative and police actions to suppress the realities of the alleged gang rape of a Dalit girl in Hathras by upper-caste men and her subsequent death. International conspiracy is an idea for a possible chorus that can be taken up by the Bharatiya Janata Party cadre and repeated ad nauseam in the hope that it can replace facts. Simultaneously, first information reports against protesters and an online site carrying information about protests are being lodged, on charges ranging from sedition and inciting conflict between groups to forgery and cheating as well as unlawful assembly, with arrests in some instances. Evidently, ?anti-national? elements, funded by foreigners, and the Opposition are going all out to hurt the image of the Yogi Adityanath government supposedly reputed for its excellent law and order. That is, the protests are contrived and motivated.

Apart from alleged efforts of the authorities to undermine the accusation of rape and the veracity of the family?s accounts, blocking Opposition leaders and members of the media from reaching the girl?s village, too, continued for days. But this showed up the rather low-key responses of the chiefs of the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party to the violence and the attempts to suppress what is being seen as a lethal upper-caste atrocity on a Dalit girl. Although Mayawati heads a Dalit-based party, all she could say was that the UP government should concentrate on ensuring justice for the Dalit family and could rectify its mistake, while rebuking the government for its silence after the family complained of threats by the district magistrate. The former firebrand leader of the party for social justice, Mulayam Singh Yadav, was silent; his son and present leader, Akhilesh Yadav, condemned the erasure of evidence by the cremation of the girl by the police and criticized the government for stopping his party workers from reaching the village. Since both leaders are on their own turf in the state, this is both disheartening and politically enigmatic.",Twisted plot: Conspiracy and the Hathras case,The Telegraph,
46,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"As the Ram temple gets under way, India must put the past of a communal struggle behind
The bhoomi pujan or the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of a grand temple for Lord Sri Ram in Ayodhya on Wednesday marks an end and a beginning. What it ends and what it begins can both be interpreted in different ways; how India collectively makes meaning out of it will define the future of the country hereon. One view is that the rising Ram temple signifies the end of perceived humiliation of the Hindus and the beginning of a new phase of their political ascendancy; the other is that it denotes the end of strife that shackled India?s potential for decades and heralds a new dawn of fraternity among religious communities. The end and the beginning, therefore, are not just open to interpretation, they hold the possibilities of change. For those who yearned for a temple at the site which they believe is the exact spot of Sri Ram?s birth, the journey so far has been tumultuous and violent. A Muslim place of worship that stood there for 464 years was demolished in 1992 to make way for the temple ? a serious crime according to the Supreme Court order last year that handed over the site to the Hindus. The proponents of the temple must consider this an occasion to seek conciliation over conquest, dialogue over diatribe, and tranquility over triumphalism.
 
The ceremony itself manifested multiple possibilities for the country?s future. In symbolism and rhetoric, the line of separation between state and religion was ominously crossed, notably by the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in it. In his speech, however, he cited Lord Ram?s adherence to justice, fairness and empathy for the vulnerable. He emphasised the importance of these values for the present. But while outlining a road map for an inclusive future, his interpretation of the past echoed familiar tropes of sectarian politics. Relitigating historical wrongs has rarely been the foundation for a harmonious and prosperous future. In India?s case, many of them are an outcome of its unpleasant encounter with British colonialism. Recent path-breaking studies in genetics have unearthed India?s past of being a melting pot of populations and cultures over millennia. India must put the acrimonious political mobilisations over religious issues behind it, and look forward to modern, secular governance. The construction of the temple is the logical result of the Supreme Court judgment; it should mark the end of an older, bitter phase of India, and the beginning of a new, harmonious phase.",Groundbreaking: On Ram temple bhoomi pujan,The Hindu,
47,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"Once again as a nation we seem to be living up to our reputation of creating a controversy on an issue that in reality should be an occasion of pride for the whole nation. After nearly five centuries aspirations of all Indians, who believe in India, are about to be realized in the form of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. Lord Ram is not only a religious deity for Hindus but also part of Indian heritage and therefore it is appropriate to say ?All Indians? instead of just limiting it to Hindus.

There was a lot of skepticism before the Supreme Court gave its verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute in November 2019. To the credit of Muslim litigants and the community as a whole, they accepted the verdict with grace and humility, a few disgruntled voices notwithstanding. This was particularly true for Hindu and Muslim communities in Ayodhya where everyone seemed to be relieved that a verdict had been reached.  They have lived there in harmony for ages and continue to do so today also when the construction of Ram Mandir is expected to start on 05 August with a simple ceremony. Both communities in Ayodhya have pledged to work towards building the temple and it is indeed a very welcome step as it also means development and prosperity for all. 

But then there are some on our country who cannot digest this simple truth. For them it is a taboo to see Hindus and Muslims standing shoulder to shoulder. Therefore, they have to create a controversy and ensure that Hindu Muslim divide raises its ugly head and vitiates the environment. The sad part is that most of these people are neither local residents of Ayodhya nor directly concerned in any manner with temple construction. Some political leaders from the opposition, a few pseudo seculars and some Muslim community leaders have jumped in the fray to question the building of the temple for various reasons. Needless to say, none of the reasons expounded by them stand to any scrutiny or have any merit. 

Some are now casting aspersions on the retired Chief Justice of India (CJI) under whose tenure the verdict was delivered while conveniently forgetting that it was a five-judge bench that delivered the judgment where CJI was just another member. One of the most senior politicians in the country wonders if building of the temple will help the nation in its fight against coronavirus? A question that frankly does not even warrant a response as it just shows a biased mindset and a deliberate lack of understanding of what Lord Ram means and stands for in this country. 

The biggest issue that seems to be bothering this anti-Mandir lobby is the decision by Door Darshan to telecast the ?Bhoomi Pujan? ceremony live. They think this move is against the secular credentials of the country, against the charter of the national broadcaster and has political connotations as BJP wishes to reach out for Hindu votes through this live broadcast. The same lobby had no problem when the visit of Pope or canonization of Mother Teresa or Haj pilgrimage bulletins were telecast live in the past apart from many other religious events for people of different faiths. For the lobby, those telecasts were within the realms of a secular India as they pertained to minority communities. But live telecast of Ram Mandir ?Bhoomi Pujan? event that has a much larger audience and significance is anti-secular. 

Without a doubt this is in line with the distorted version of secularism that has been practiced in the country for nearly seven decades where anything to do with Hindu or Hinduism is anti-secular. For any right-thinking Indian, irrespective of his religion, Ayodhya event has to be seen as a national event that is linked to nation?s heritage first and foremost. Any linkage to Hindu religion comes later. If any Indian cannot accept this axiomatic truth then his being a true Indian itself will be questionable. 

There has been a lot of debate on the participation of Prime Minister in the event in Ayodhya on 05 August. It is nothing but a ploy by Modi baiters to deride the Prime Minister. For many of them it is their only vocation since Mr Modi assumed the highest elected office in the country in 2014. Are Prime Ministers not allowed to have their beliefs as individuals? Nowhere dose the Indian constitution say that such leaders cannot practice their religion. Is it possible to believe that none of India?s past Presidents, Vice Presidents or Prime Ministers ever visited a religious place of worship? Ayodhya event is a once in a life time event for the nation. Attendance of the Prime Minister, who is holder of the highest elected office in the country, is warranted in his capacity as the NUMBER ONE representative of the people. 

Some have questioned the wisdom of holding ?Bhoomi Pujan? when the nation is going through the current Corona pandemic. Suffice it to say that all safeguards will be in place and all preventive measures taken as required. There are some who have put forth an argument that if this event can be allowed why not allow Id celebrations that are around the corner. This is again a very motivated argument aimed at creating mistrust and to stroke communal tensions. The festival of Id comes every year unlike the Ayodhya event which is a one-time event that the nation has been waiting for five centuries. Next, a festival like Id will mean thousands of congregations across the country unlike the Ayodhya event which is restricted to one place. It is obvious that while a single national event can be organized in a controlled manner with all precautionary measures in place, it will be impossible to exercise similar control over thousands of localized and uncontrolled Id events across the country. A similar logic would be applicable to Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja and Diwali events this year if the pandemic threat continues to loom over the nation. 

It has to be understood that ?Bhoomi Pujan? for Ram Temple is not a political event. But given the opposition?s opposition to the event, there is a danger of it being seen as one. If that happens the onus will be on the opposition and not the government of the day. If there is any indirect political fallout from the event in favour of Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) then there is very little the opposition can do about it. However, by opposing it and coming out with lop sided statements and baseless reasons on why it should not be held, the opposition is only ensuring political gains for BJP. Frankly a mature opposition should have seen the writing on the wall and supported the event. That would have resulted in a favorable political fallout for them many times more than what BJP may get today. But then current Indian political opposition and maturity were divorced five years ago and a remarriage is nowhere on the cards given the quality of their leaders",The Ram temple ?bhoomi pujan? controversy,The times of India,
48,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"Notwithstanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s impressive address in Ayodhya to build an inclusive India based on the ideals of Ramrajya of social harmony, justice, piety, love and peace, the edifice of the Indian republic remains damaged.

By performing bhoomipujan for Ram Mandir, PM Modi junked his constitutional oath of office that makes it mandatory for him to ?discharge all duties faithfully and conscientiously? for the Union and ?do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will?.

The very act signals a resolve to replace constitutional virtues of justice, secularism, equality and fraternity with equivalent concepts acceptable to Hindu majoritarianism.

There is no parallel of such gross departure from the Constitution in the history of independent India.

Only two acts come close enough ? installation of Somnath temple after its renovation in May 1951 by President Rajendra Prasad and, Rajiv Gandhi?s approval to open Babri mosque?s locks (where idols were surreptitiously installed in 1949) in 1986.

The first act was strongly opposed by Jawaharlal Nehru. After cautioning his minister K.M. Munshi of the dangers of ?Hindu revivalism?, Nehru told Rajendra Babu, ?I confess I do not like the idea of you associating yourself with a spectacular opening of the Somnath temple. This is not merely visiting a temple? but rather participating in a significant function which unfortunately has a number of implications.?

Nehru's warning, not to mix religion with statecraft, proved prophetic.

The blunder by his grandson led to shilanayas of the temple in 1989 and a militant movement to release the idols from ?captivity?. It prompted L.K. Advani to launch Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 that culminated in demolishing Babri Mosque, thus, badly scarring the syncretic fabric of India.

Innumerable communal riots and rise of extremist Islam in the immediate aftermath bear a testimony of this folly.

Justice suffered a blow in November 2019 when the Supreme Court overturned Allahabad high court judgement and handed over the entire 2.77 acres of land to the deity despite no archaeological evidence to back such a claim.

 With this, it removed the final hinge holding the secular character of India to pave way for a de jure Hindu Rashtra.

Why the foundation ceremony in times of crises?

The answer lies in the word ? crises. The Hindutva forces chose August 5 precisely to smother the rising anger against the blunders the Modi government committed through draconian demonetisation, faulty GST, accosting crony capitalists at the expense of public exchequer and erroneous handling of Covid-19 pandemic.

Despite efforts to hide and manipulate data, the ground realities show the deep crises India has been sucked into.

PM Modi managed to hide poverty by constructing a wall around a shanty alongside President Trump?s route from Gandhinagar Airport to Motera stadium but walls cannot be built across India.
A rosy picture cannot be painted in the midst of a plunging economy when millions start marching to villages for fear of dying of hunger.

In such a scenario, any people-centric government would pull all stops to tackle the crises. But what a government would do whose sole concern is to win elections to forward its bigoted agenda?
It will do what it knows best, build a smokescreen to divert people?s attention from real issues and keep them on a high with a sense of purpose to win elections.

This is precisely what the Modi government has done despite the dangers of Covid-19 that is now growing fastest in India. The rest of the agenda has already been put to practice.

A web of pliant television channels and an army of social media trolls will try to keep the public discourse limited to Ram Mandir and PM Modi?s aura to help BJP win upcoming elections in states of Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.
The ultimate aim is to keep crises shrouded in this smokescreen until the inauguration of Ram Mandir in 2024 to ensure a dream run for a third straight win in Lok Sabha elections.

The onus to save Indian democracy now squarely lies upon Opposition parties and democratic, progressive liberal forces that lie scattered on the Indian political scene.

It has been made a wee bit more difficult by PM Modi?s smart move to change the narrative, from militant Hindutva to Ram?s inclusivity. Yet they can still do the impossible by getting together to pull down this smokescreen and help people see the reality that lies exposed everywhere.

By doing so they will do justice to the Maryadapurshottam who gave up his throne and embraced exile to help his father satisfy the whims of crafty stepmother, Kaikeyi. He is again being used to break the maryada of the Constitution to establish a New Republic by an equally crafty political party. Hey Ram!",Progressives must unite to expose government?s ?Ram? narrative,The Asian age,
49,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"In an unusual move that has left everyone bemused, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose to play an  all-encompassing role during the bhoomi pujan in Ayodhya on August 5. He was not only the chief guest but also the master of ceremonies and the official yajmaan (patron of a religious ritual) during the ceremony. 

In certain quarters, an analogy has been drawn between Modi?s participation in the Ayodhya mega event and the presence of India?s first President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, at the inaugural ceremony of the reconstructed Somnath temple in 1951. 

However, the two instances cannot be compared. Unlike Ayodhya, there was nothing divisive about the inaugural ceremony at Somnath, since it was not performed at a site that was disputed or mired in a long-standing, contentious legal battle. 

Conventionally, a prime minister would attend such an event as the chief guest, while the key rituals would be performed by a religious leader present on the occasion ? in  Ayodhya, it would be someone like Mahant Nritya Gopaldas, who is not only the head of the old Ramjanmbhoomi Nyas and the newly formed, government-constituted Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust  but also the senior-most seer in the temple town. He has had a long association with the Ram temple movement.

It is well known that Nritya Gopaldas was earlier sore about the fact that the formal ritual of transferring the deity of Ram ?Lalla? from the makeshift temple to an interim structure, to facilitate the new temple?s construction was carried out by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yogi Adityanath. He was pacified only after he was named president of the Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust.

The puja could also have been performed by one of the Shankaracharyas, but they were not present at the ceremony. As for the 140-odd religious figures who were present at the venue, they were there only as a token presence and had little to do with the puja.

It was Modi alone who played a larger-than-life role that day, as if displaying a sense of ownership of the event. That was the message conveyed to 130 crore Indians, to whom he made repeated references.

Meanwhile, with all the frontline leaders of the temple movement being kept away on the day of the bhoomi poojan, it was deafeningly clear that it was a Modi show all the way. Even the fact that, ultimately, a Supreme Court verdict had made the event possible, was relegated to the background. The man on the street seemed to be attributing the credit for the Ram temple to just one man ? ?Prime Minister Narendra Modi?.

Indeed, as far as the messaging was concerned, nothing was left to chance. Some of the key BJP leaders who had spearheaded the temple movement in its early days ? and are now facing trial in the Babri Masjid demolition case ? were not extended invitations for the ceremony.  

On the face of it, the invitations had been issued by the new 15-member Trust ? after all, the prime minister also  said, ?I am grateful to the Trust for inviting me here? ? but the Trust itself, which has also been entrusted with the task of temple construction, was constituted by the Union government! 

Moreover, none other than Nripendra Misra, former IAS officer who was PM Modi?s most-trusted bureaucrat as his principal secretary, is the Trust?s chief executive. How the guest list must have been drawn up is fairly obvious.  

It may be convenient to cite the pandemic as a valid enough reason to keep the ?oldies? at a ?safe? distance. But there are many within the party fold who are wondering if it may not have been more appropriate to extend an invitation to former party stalwarts like Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi or Kalyan Singh and left it to them to decide.  

Other than UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, it was the RSS chief, Mohan Bhagwat, who was accorded some significance. He not only addressed the gathering but also went to the extent of prompting the priest to speed up the proceedings.

That was not all. No religious leader from Ayodhya was included among the nine priests who carried out the puja, led by Acharya Gangadhar Pathak. He was handpicked by the organisers from Vrindavan, where he is not counted among the important religious leaders.  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with UP Governor Anandiben Patel, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and others perform Bhoomi Pujan rituals for the construction of the Ram Mandir, at Ayodhya on August 5. Photo: PTI

While Acharya Pathak and three others were seated near the place where the ritual was being conducted, four priests stood around as chaperons to assist in the ritual. Acharya Govind Dev Giri, from Pune, who is the treasurer of the Trust, was seated there throughout the ritual. 

Many wondered why a lesser known priest from a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) sponsored ashram like the Keshav Dham in Vrindavan was asked to carry out the puja at the high-profile event. As the event progressed, the mystery was solved. What was interesting ? and clearly visible ? was the fact that he was carrying a written script to conduct the 35-minute ritual! The benefit of having a relatively unknown priest lead the puja were evident, for he spent more time singing paeans to the prime minister than on the ritual.","At Ayodhya Bhoomi Pujan, Modi Became All-in-One; Proper Rituals Not Followed, Allege Pundits",The Wire,
50,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"August 5 is the culmination of movements that powered the BJP's idea of India, how it takes it forward is the test

India?s secularism has been a variant of the traditional western notion of the strict wall of separation between church and state.
August 5, when construction of the Ram temple began at Ayodhya ? one year after the abrogation of Article 370 by the BJP-led Centre in Kashmir ? marks a milestone for the BJP, and for India. For the BJP, it will have a tidy resonance. On August 5, it achieved its grand cause, which had energised its politics and powered several mobilisations for decades.

The issue that coalition politics compelled it to place on the ?backburner? in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime has now journeyed to the centre, flamboyant and triumphant, in Narendra Modi raj. Of the two large national political projects that reconfigured India?s politics in the early 1990s ? Mandal and Mandir ? the former met with only scattered and fragmented success while the BJP has led the latter to full and unequivocal fulfilment. But if the BJP has reason to celebrate a conclusion, for India, the beginning of temple construction at Ayodhya underlines a challenge. The leading role of the Prime Minister, Chief Minister and Governor at an event ostensibly organised by the Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust was foretold. Even so, its images, of intimacies between state and religion, have implications that will need to be grappled with in days and years to come.

India?s secularism has been a variant of the traditional western notion of the strict wall of separation between church and state. The Indian version has described itself, more, as being about a state that keeps equal distance from all religions but respects them all. Now, even that increasingly embattled idea of equi-distance will need to be qualified or redefined. Of course, this task is the burden of the non-BJP parties, should they have the stomach for it, which, so far, they don?t.

In the BJP?s narrative, on the other hand, a discredited secularism has deservedly fallen. At Ayodhya on Wednesday, Prime Minister Modi sought to draw parallels between the bhoomi pujan on August 5 and August 15, Independence Day. A five-centuries-old struggle had triumphed in the liberation of an idea that will now be the link, the PM said, between ?nar? and ?narayan? (man and god), ?lok? and ?aastha? (people and faith) ?vartman? and ?ateet? (past and present). The Ram temple, he said would be an inspiration for a self-confident and self-reliant India on the world stage.

The BJP?s political opponents may not rise to the challenge posed by the far-reaching changes in political culture wrought by it ? both the first anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 and the bricklaying for the temple at Ayodhya have been met by the same sullen silence, if not acquiescence. But as the ruling party at the Centre of a diverse nation, the BJP must be mindful of the dangers of majoritarian triumphalism. Even the Supreme Court, which paved the way for the temple by giving the disputed site to the Hindu side, described the 1992 destruction of the Babri masjid as illegal. The demolition case continues in court. At Ayodhya on Wednesday, there was no mention of the debris of the mosque that lies under the proposed temple, or of the exclusions of faith-based politics. These need to be acknowledged and addressed. Only then can the invocation of national unity ? by virtually the entire political establishment today ? ring sincere.",Brick and milestone,The Indian Express,
51,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"Nobody is stalling the Ram temple but the grand bhumi pujan in pandemic times raises uncomfortable questions

The timing, they say, is everything. So once the Supreme Court paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya, respecting civilisational belief and the heave of collective emotion and faith ? one that had been appropriated by politics ? one would have expected the exhibitionist propaganda around it to ebb away. Yet a grand bhumi pujan or foundation-laying ceremony is being planned during the nation?s worst time, in the middle of a pandemic, natural disasters and a stalled economy, if only to keep the temple agenda, and by extension those who live off it politically, alive. Everybody may be looking towards divine intercession in helpless times but does that behove the temple trust to host a grand ceremony, the expensive resources for which could be used for much-needed COVID-19 relief, or take liberties with social distancing rules as 250 guests, including 50 VIPs, are expected to attend a public gathering? The Government?s own advisory against public outings for those above 60 will be defeated as most guests, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and margdarshaks LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, are above that age limit. Question is whether these leaders will prize their religiosity over public service and messaging. Five silver bricks, symbolising the five planets as per Hindu mythology, will be used to lay the foundation, 11 priests from Varanasi and Ayodhya will congregate to do the rituals and to ward off evil spirits, silver figurines of a male and female snake and a tortoise will be buried at the construction site. Huge CCTV screens will dot Ayodhya for devotees to catch a glimpse of the proceedings, never mind if it encourages some kind of crowding. Granted, the ruling BJP has ridden a majoritarian wave to get its verdict and in the absence of a challenging Opposition, will ride the pandemic trough out, efficient or not. So it doesn?t need to mount another lavish showcase of its Hindu pride. Unless it wants to divert attention from its mishandling of the economy and burdening India?s migrant workforce. Agreed, it has to satisfy its core constituency of Hindu voters and ideologues but does that mean humouring them to such an extent that consciously privileges them and their rights over followers of other faiths and practices despite pandemic restrictions? And while world over prayers are on, wishing the end of COVID-19, how can the temple authorities justify that prayers during the ceremony on August 3 or August 5, being the most auspicious days, would help in ridding the country of the virus?

Of course, the political undertones are not too difficult to miss. The expected ceremony coincides with the first anniversary of the revocation of special status of the former State of Jammu & Kashmir and the abrogation of Article 370. While the Government may claim to have enacted that within a constitutional space and is already trotting out figures of developmental funding to justify the conversion of territories, the celebrations at Ayodhya say otherwise. They are meant to be a mid-term campaign of the Modi Government that it has fulfilled the promises made in its manifesto in record time. The event is also an indication that identity politics, which had been derailed by the pandemic, will gain momentum, examples of which are apparent from the way the Government is pursuing dissenters and activists even in the middle of a pandemic. Take the case of Varavara Rao, who was arrested in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case in 2018, which is now with the NIA. At 80, he is COVID-19 positive and was moved to a hospital much later. There is radio silence on his status with his family unaware of his condition. The Opposition criticism came from Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who said instead of a bhumi pujan now, the Government should focus on the pandemic and the economy. But the Modi Government, which has apportioned health management to respective States and knows that it could pass the buck in case of a worsening disease spiral to them, can hardly be expected to share Pawar?s concerns over Maharashtra, the worst-hit State. Congress leader Digvijaya Singh joined the chorus after Pawar made the move. But both leaders represent the ruling coalition in Maharashtra as partners of the Shiv Sena, which lauded the temple construction and claimed to have ?laid the road? to it, ?not for politics but out of faith.? The political fissures were all too apparent as Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray would attend and that the fight against the virus was being fought ?by our doctors in white attire, whom we call devdoot (messenger of God).? Question is whether Lord Ram himself would have condoned such celebrations or helped the sick instead. The problem is that there is no end to the temple card; it will continue to be used for historical corrections that are guided by narrow political considerations. Ayodhya?s god-king wouldn?t like his maryada to be tampered with. Yet, who cares?",Message or faith?,The Pioneer,
52,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"A legal dispute dating back to the late 19th century, a question of faith going back even longer, and a political issue that has shaped Indian politics for three decades were all addressed by the Supreme Court on Saturday, when it ruled on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue.

The court ruled in favour of a temple at Ayodhya, where many people believe Hindu God Ram was born, but also sought to address what it describes as a wrong committed against Muslims (especially during the 1992 demolition of a mosque that stood at the disputed site) by giving the Sunni Waqf Board five acres elsewhere in Ayodhya for a mosque.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has had the building of a Ram temple at Ayodhya as one of the fixtures in its manifesto, described the verdict as neither a victory nor a defeat, eschewing triumphalism, as indeed he has asked his colleagues to. Mohan Bhagwat, the supremo of the BJP?s ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has, directly, and through its affiliates, been at the forefront of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, echoed that sentiment.

While there?s been some talk (but no confirmation) of the Muslim parties seeking a review, most analysts are of the opinion that the court?s ruling marks the effective closure of the movement to build a temple. As such, it is a decision that has national, social, and political impact.

At the political level, the resolution of the temple issue means that 2019 has seen the end of both Mandal and mandir (temple) issues. The first refers to the 1990 implementation of the Mandal Commission?s report, reserving 27% of government jobs and college seats for Other Backward Classes. For at least three decades after that, the country?s political landscape was largely shaped by Mandal?s biggest beneficiaries. It was only the parliamentary elections of 2019 that finally seemed to put the ghost of Mandal to rest .

If Mandal gave India?s political landscape a clutch of parties that would dominate at least regional politics for three decades, the mandir movement gave it the BJP. The temple was the singular issue that helped revive the party?s fortunes after it slipped to two Lok Sabha seats in the 1984 parliamentary elections. Still, it was only after Narendra Modi and Amit Shah figured out a way to also consolidate the non-dominant OBC groupings that it really emerged the pole of Indian politics.
The verdict delivered by the Supreme Court is the beginning of the end of the mandir issue. Sure, its effects will be felt perhaps even in 2024 (it is likely that it will take a few years to build the temple, which is perfect timing for the next Lok Sabha polls), but not beyond. Which means 2019 has been a milestone year for the two significant political issues that have pretty much shaped Indian politics over the past three decades. It is the year one became irrelevant, and the other neared (if not achieved) closure.

At the national level, the overwhelming feeling seems to be one of relief. The movement to build a temple has had violent turns in the past, including the demolition of the mosque, and the nationwide riots that followed. India has many pressing issues and can?t afford to be held back by such conflicts. Much, though, will depend on whether the court?s decision encourages the RSS and its affiliates to seek similar resolution of other disputes involving places of worship. The organisation has said that it will not. Much also will depend on how the Muslim parties to the dispute react to the judgment. Seeking a review of the decision is within their rights, although they must respect the verdict ? and they have said that they will. A compromise formula agreed to by some of the Muslim parties to the dispute has some commonalities with the verdict, which means that at least some of them do want to move on.

At the social level, there are two alternative ways to view the verdict. One is to see it as a deeply polarising judgment that alienates the country?s Muslims, some of whom already see themselves being targeted by a State they perceive to be majoritarian. The other is to see it as a unifying one, which addresses one of the most sticky issues in the country, and attempts to strike a balance. With that out of the way, Hindus and Muslims could well aspire to arrive at a new equilibrium, one that puts the country first.","Finally, a closure on Ayodhya",The Hindustan Times,
53,Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan,"The majority of Congress leaders and workers believe that the Ram temple bhoomi pujan spectacle in Ayodhya on Wednesday, portrayed as a historic moment of triumph for Hindus, will allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi to divert the nation?s attention for a while but the real concerns would soon return to dominate the political discourse.

Although a section in the Congress, particularly ordinary party workers, is doubtless rattled and is in awe of Modi?s capacity to hijack the discourse, many senior leaders hope it is premature to presume that the tide of negativity against the government?s many failures and the multiple crises facing the nation has turned and the Ram temple will override other issues for the next few years.

They admit that Modi will create a much bigger hype at the time of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections and finally during the inauguration of the temple before the 2024 parliamentary polls, but its emotive appeal will diminish in the absence of any tangible opposition to its construction.


A leader told The Telegraph: ?There is no denying the fact that Modi has used this occasion for perception management. He had been grappling with the worst crisis of his political career: while the economy is in ruin, the humanitarian crisis caused by the coronavirus has demolished the myth of his administrative skills. No country has witnessed such distressing scenes of millions (of migrants) walking hundreds of miles without food or water. Unemployment created a deep unrest among youths.?

He added: ?Against the grim backdrop of multiple crises, his helplessness on the Chinese intrusion almost unravelled his image as a strong leader. He was obviously shaken and opted to organise this event even though there was no muhurt (auspicious timing) according to astrology.

?This was always going to be a momentous occasion and we knew the RSS-BJP would present it as a never-before moment of Hindu triumph. They have exhausted the opportunity too soon. It will be difficult to sustain the hype for long.?

Asked if the Congress had any internal discussion before Priyanka Gandhi Vadra set the tone by talking about Lord Ram signifying unification, righteousness and sacrifice without directly drawing a parallel with the RSS-BJP?s perceived divisive agenda, a party functionary said: ?There were discussions at informal levels. When nobody opposed the verdict delivered by the Supreme Court, the only course left for us was to highlight the dichotomy between the RSS-BJP?s narrow politics and Lord Ram?s philosophy.

?We knew the temple construction would benefit the BJP. It must have been the cynical assessment of all parties that the absence of any opposition to the construction of the temple would minimise the political advantage the RSS-BJP expects from the event. We hope this is true, no matter how hard they try to project it as a transformative occasion.?

Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, too, traversed the safe path laid by Priyanka, saying Lord Ram can never manifest himself through hatred, cruelty and injustice. Prime Minister Modi on Wednesday also dwelt on the lofty ideals of Lord Ram, no matter how divisive the campaign in the run-up to the event had been.

Rahul also made a subtle attempt to indicate that Modi?s politics had been antithetical to the ideals symbolised by Ram as it selectively targeted opposition, suppressed institutions, discriminated against minorities and ran an unjust regime without following the principles of transparency and accountability.

Rahul tweeted: ?Maryada Purushottam Bhagwan Ram is a symbol of supreme humane values. He is the essence of the intrinsic humanity that lies in our hearts. Ram is love; he can never manifest himself through hate. Ram is compassion; he can never manifest himself through cruelty. Ram is justice; he can never manifest himself through injustice.?

Congress leaders insist that the future political discourse will have to revolve around issues such as the economy, jobs, democratic values and foreign relations.

They say the intervention in the temple discourse has a limited purpose ? to send out a message that the Congress is not opposed to the construction and the BJP is not the sole representative of Hindus in India.

The Congress leaders also contest the perception that the party felt compelled to pursue ?soft Hindutva?, arguing that it never saw secularism as being irreligious.

A former Union minister told this newspaper: ?There are abnormal pressures of mass politics on certain occasions. We do have to temporarily alter the articulation when the atmosphere is surcharged, when emotions are running high and explaining nuances becomes difficult. But the core philosophy doesn?t change.

?Our stress on justice, on cultural harmony, on compassion? is an expression of our secular commitment in a different language. Those who have misunderstood will soon realise how fiercely we will safeguard the secular principles. That commitment is sacred.?",Ram temple: Congress awaits return of real concerns,The Telegraph,
54,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"The state must get tough on crime, but the police should not be allowed to break the law
The Uttar Pradesh Police?s account of the killing of Kanpur gangster Vikas Dubey on Friday, even if taken at face value, is a startling admission of serious ineptitude. But the official narrative, as it stands, stretches the bounds of credulity to an astonishing extent. The possibility that his death is officially sanctioned retribution for the murder of eight policemen who were part of the team that went to arrest him on July 3 is hard to dismiss out of hand. Without a doubt, Dubey?s death in an ?exchange of fire? while he was ?trying to flee? after the police vehicle in which he was being taken ?met with an accident? is also extremely convenient for many; it puts a lid on the sordid tale of his violent rise to power and influence, which was nourished by a wider network of patrons, including some in the police force. A hardened criminal, who had 62 cases against him before his gang allegedly shot dead eight policemen last week, was supposedly being transported without handcuffs; he snatched weapons from those escorting him, according to the police version of the incident. Indeed, this is no more than a self-indictment of the state police, whose conduct has raised far too many questions in the recent past. There is no good explanation for driving such a suspect through the night across more than 600 km from Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh where he was arrested on Thursday. The brutal last episode of Dubey?s serial crimes should be no defence if the shooting turns out to be an extra-judicial killing.

Any demand of probity and accountability in police and military is often contested on the supposed ground that it emerges from a support for criminals, terrorists or enemies of the state by influential political and public figures. There is no question that crimes such as those Dubey was involved in must be met with exemplary punishment. The process of establishing guilt and executing punishment is not an incidental part of justice, but its integral soul. A fair and transparent trial cannot be dispensed with in order to satisfy cries for vengeance. Social sanction of instant justice by state agents might have leached into institutions that are mandated to enforce the rule of law. Last year, when the Cyberabad police shot dead four people accused in a case of gang rape and murder, people celebrated in the streets. The courts and the National Human Rights Commission have also shown a lenient approach in such cases. Goading the police on to deliver instant justice, or even tolerating such behaviour, creates an atmosphere of impunity that could lead to murder of innocent people as happened with the custodial deaths in Tamil Nadu. Support for such killings by the police will not make a society more just. Mob justice is no justice at all. When law enforcers short-circuit due process, the damage to state institutions is severe and long-lasting.",Crime as punishment: On the killing of Vikas Dubey,The Hindu,
55,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"Six days of a broad manhunt later, fugitive gangster Vikas Dubey was arrested in Madhya Pradesh yesterday and handed over to the Uttar Pradesh police. Today morning he was killed. The UP police say Dubey fired at them after a road accident overturned their vehicle, and then they shot him in self-defense.

Even as commentators rip holes in the police story, the bigger giveaway is that this incident is part of a pattern. Three close aides of Dubey were killed in recent days in similar encounters in Etawah, Kanpur and Hamirpur. If those encounters were staged and the men shot dead in cold blood, then it?s obviously no justification that these men are accused of shooting dead eight policemen in Kanpur?s Bikru village last week. What is at stake is the rule of law, which UP police often seem to believe they are above.
In this particular case, another worry is that the police-criminal-political nexus that needed exposing in the Vikas Dubey case is now going to get a quiet burial. But that is the problem with men in khaki either being incompetent or running rogue. If the state has become incapable of upholding basic constitutional precepts, then the Supreme Court must step in and set it right.",Encounter Pradesh ? Where Vikas Dubey is shot dead before trial,The times of India,
56,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"Headline on Wednesday, July 10: Vikas Dubey arrested. Shabaash. Breaking news a little later: Vikas Dubey shot dead. Wah! Badhiya hai! How convenient. Let?s check out the various and very imaginative versions of this bloody drama.

The man with a murderous past was apparently ?caught? by a security guard at Ujjain?s Mahakal temple, after he and his wife bought prasad and performed aarti. The criminal on the run crossed several checkposts and travelled undetected across four states before getting nabbed. All of this sounds bogus to me.

 

A man who has been running a parallel state within a state for years in Yogi Adityanath?s Wild West territory, also known as Uttar Pradesh, gets picked up a few days later in another state (Madhya Pradesh) and then the ?usual? happens! He gets shot trying to ?escape? from a police party when a vehicle overturns! All this action takes place seven days after his henchmen ambush and gun down eight policemen in cold blood. Relax, everyone!

Now that the mastermind behind the attack has been bumped off, we will never get to know what exactly happened or why.

Let?s say it was a huge setup, with betrayals, informers, and political connivance involved. Nobody would dare to ambush and open fire on men in vardi, without being guaranteed protection by political bosses. Even the most hardened criminals hesitate before taking on the men in uniform. Dubey?s subsequent arrest and murder are clearly a part of the huge coverup, now that the game is up. It sounds like the most brazen and audacious political charade.

 

A total eyewash? and complete hogwash. The same men, from the same party that was working hand in glove with the criminal, seem to have struck a deal with political bosses of another party, and smoothly staged the arrest and encounter killing, but only after doing a deal with Vikas Dubey himself. Endgame!

This is how it has always worked in India. Nothing new about this narrative. There?s a blurred line between netas and goondas, political bosses and hardcore criminals ? this is true across parties. In fact, it?s pretty hard to distinguish one lot (gangsters) from the other (netas).

Sometimes, very rarely, the situation gets completely out of hand -- as it did in Dubey?s case. All hell breaks loose, but only for a while. You can be sure while citizens are kept distracted with hocus pocus stories about the valour and efficiency of the police party involved in the drama, frantic negotiations are taking place simultaneously between the criminal?s family, his gang members and their political patrons.

 

During the time all these hardworking folks are busy cutting deals and managing the division of loot, others are busy buying time, till all the stolen monies are secured and the incriminatory trails are fixed. This time is very precious indeed. It?s like the golden hour in medical terminology. Millions are at stake, and several mighty political reputations on the line.

The stash has to be protected at all costs, as also the identities of the political bosses for whom criminals like Vikas Dubey work. The money trail must be hastily covered up and as much evidence destroyed as possible. This needs the intervention of experts and techies, who can efficiently destroy files and create alibis. Generally, 48 hours are sufficient for eliminating all compromising evidence. Some inconvenient people can also be blown away along the way.

 

The few that are left behind can be managed with pressure from the investigating agencies. One just has to lean on them. In return for such big favours, the rewards are pretty impressive and there?s a well-understood modus operandi to fix remaining loopholes. The heat is turned up, only after all these areas are sealed. The rest is pure drama, scripted by intelligence officers and corrupt bureaucrats. It is an eyewash that only the gullible believe.

The ludicrous sequence of Dubey?s arrest and death has been better choreographed than some clumsier encounters from the past. It started with Dubey?s nephew being shot dead, with two compromised cops and four aides getting hauled in. Errrrr? the nephew has been the gangster?s shadow for the longest time. But of course nobody could find him? till now.

 

Gangsterism runs in the family and is conducted like any business across India. The rule of terror unleashed is so dreadful, not a single police thana dares to intrude into the well- fortified dens of men like Dubey, with heavily armed ?soldiers? protecting the don. Gangsters live their lives with complete impunity, with nobody to fear. Successive governments kowtow to them and openly display solidarity, by attending wedding and family functions. The looted money is shared by whichever neta happens to be in power.

Take a look at some of the photographs floating around of Dubey with several political leaders.

The multi-billion dollar question is this: Why has nobody as much as tried to crack the D-Gang nexus? For decades one heard stories about how seamlessly this global network of some of the most dangerous people alive operates. D-Gang watchers also know about the multiple business interests and dealings that have gone on without a break all these years.

The names of heavyweight politicians and movie stars who are business partners with underworld goons come up periodically. Despite all the buzz around these nefarious activities, no action is ever taken, nor any investigations launched. Whether it involves airline deals, real estate or Bollywood -- dhanda merrily stays dhanda -- no questions asked.

It?s a wonder Dubey was nabbed in the first place. Citizens were pretty certain he?d be provided safe passage out of India -- as have many other hardcore criminals before him. Making Dubey an example must have been an afterthought? and only because of the brazenness with which the sitting duck policemen were gunned down.

Those who tipped off the gangster about the raid have already been taken care of. Watch out for a fresh bunch of suspects who will be paraded before the media, and made to take the rap, while shielding the political patrons who set up the ambush in the first place, believing they?d get away with it yet again.

Well, they almost did! But like with everything else in life, it?s payout time now. Someone?s head has got to roll. Let it be Dubey?s?while his political bosses have the last laugh, which is, as always, on us!",Gangsterism in politics: Vikas Dubey in UP's Wild West,The Asian age,
57,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"After meekly surrendering in Ujjain on Thursday, the gangster mustered enough courage Friday to snatch a gun from the police and fire at them. If the state had bothered to corroborate this outlandish script, the cop who allowed Dubey to take his service weapon should have been suspended by now.
Notorious gangster Vikas Dubey?s end came in the same dramatic manner as that of many others who have had their share of infamy in the world of crime. India has seen his kind before ? men whose names spelt terror but destiny took them to their logical end when they finally fell to police bullets.

No one seems to dispute that Dubey deserved to meet his nemesis. Yet, the manner in which the Uttar Pradesh police silenced him forever has also conveniently shut the book of his chequered criminal career. That this book had unopened chapters which would have brought to the fore his obvious nexus with politicians who were there all along in his journey to making him an underworld don is what makes his killing in an encounter on Friday so controversial.

Dubey?s rise from local hoodlum to the position of a privileged gangster would not have been possible without the active patronage of successive UP state governments and their leaders, who were always ready to keep their doors open for him. The gangster came in handy for them when they needed his support at the time of elections ? not only to garner the local Brahmin vote in Kanpur (Dehat) district, but to also provide them muscle power.

Dubey earned his spurs as a dreaded gangster with the sensational daylight murder of a prominent Bhartiya Janata Party leader, Santosh Shukla, whom he gunned down inside the precincts of a rural police station precisely 19 years ago. It was a bright and pleasant afternoon on October 12, 2001, when local villagers and policemen helplessly watched Dubey pump half a dozen bullets into Shukla?s temple and chest from point blank range.

That was the day his area saw the birth of a don. When the trial court eventually acquitted him, he quickly rose to become the uncrowned king of the world of crime in and around Kanpur (Dehat). ?Lack of evidence? and the absence of a single eyewitness set him free. Though there was nothing unusual for ordinary eyewitnesses in UP to turn hostile when it comes to deposing before a court of law, what Dube managed to do was exercise his undue influence even on uniformed policemen drawing their salaries from the state exchequer. Each of the two dozen odd policemen present in the police station at the time of Shukla?s murder deposed before the court that they had not seen anything. Sure enough, if the government of the day wanted ? the state was ruled by a BJP regime headed by Rajnath Singh when Shukla was killed and the trial ran ? no policeman could have dared to depose in a manner that would help the murderer to get away. Yet, that is what happened ?  despite the fact that Shukla was senior enough in the party?s pecking order to have been accorded the rank of a minister in the government despite losing his own election.

Shukla held Dubey responsible for turning the election tide against him by extending support to his Bahujan Samaj Party rival, Harish Chandra Srivastava. He made it a point to get several criminal complaints registered against Dubey, who did not figure in the list of local criminals until then.

Sure enough, Shukla?s cold blooded murder followed by Dubey?s acquittal became a turning point in his career of crime. Governments came and went in the subsequent years but Dubey?s clout grew with each ruling dispensation ? be it the BSP, Samajwadi Party or the BJP. The reason was simple ? everyone found his caste and muscle potential ?useful? in serving their respective political ambitions.

The caste-ridden politics of Uttar Pradesh led him to emerge as some kind of a Brahmin strongman, who could ensure the votes of his community within his domain of influence that was growing by leaps and bounds. Irrespective of political party, his followers would go all the way for whoever Dubey backed. And the parties paid him back too with their support. When his wife contested a zila panchayat election, he managed to get her the support of both the SP and BJP. Posters with leaders of both parties were put up on display.

Among the leaders of various parties the gangster was seen posing proudly in pictures for is Brijesh Pathak, once a BSP MP and currently law minister in the Yogi Adityanath government.

Known for switching loyalties with every change of guard in Lucknow, Dubey had his well-wishers in all parties. It was his close connections with people who matter that made it convenient for him to get ?arrested? on Thursday outside the Maha-Kal temple in Madhya Pradesh?s Ujjain, where he managed to reach after travelling at least 1400 km via Delhi, Faridabad and Rajasthan.

By effecting his arrest in Ujjain in full view of the public, Dubey hoped to save himself from an ?encounter? which he felt the UP police was bent upon carrying out. However, whatever assurances he had received proved to be useless. Within hours of being handed over to the UP police, he was shot dead. And with that, the lid has been put on a Pandora?s Box that could have spilled the identities of political bigwigs in his network. That the dead do not speak is a big source of relief for all those who had their nexus with him and were worried about getting exposed were he to survive.

And that clearly includes not only those belonging to the political class but also the black sheep in the police.

So it came to pass that the dreaded gangster who meekly went into custody ? when he was supposedly spotted and cornered in an Ujjain temple by a priest and flower-seller, who tipped off temple security and in turn, the police ? mustered enough courage to not only snatch a gun from the policemen who were bringing him home in a highly secured vehicle escorted by four other vehicles but even fired shots at them.

If the UP police are to be believed, he also managed to flee from the police vehicle, which tumbled somewhere along on the route after encountering a ?herd of cows? (what else!), thereby compelling the contingent of some six dozen policemen to shoot him down after a brief ?chase?.

If the police had taken care to corroborate their outlandish script, the officer who proved incapable of protecting his own service weapon should have been suspended or fired by now. In any case, less said the better about a a well-equipped police contingent being unable to keep a dangerous fugitive under their physical control.

Top criminal lawyers of Lucknow find the story ?too nave? and ?utterly weak?even for a fourth-rate Bollywood thriller. ?Vikas Dubey?s encounter shows that the UP government does not believe in the criminal justice system laid down in our democratic constitution; they neither need courts nor lawyers; their police decides who is a criminal and they award the punishment?, senior advocate I.B.Singh told The Wire. ?In my long judicial career I have come across several fake encounters, but never before have I experienced any carried out as shoddily as this one , which simply reflects the contempt that the UP police has for the law of the land of which they are supposed to be the guardians.?

Another senior lawyer, L.P.Misra, said, ?I wonder if we are still living in a democratic state where the police appear to be turning into criminals?. First, the cops went about demolishing Dubey?s house in gross violation of law and in the bargain also destroyed evidence. And now they have killed him in cold blood ? and they call it encounter.?",The Real Story is Not Vikas Dubey's 'Encounter' but the Chapters His Killing Has Closed,The Wire,
58,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"The case of Vikas Dubey, the gangster who was arrested by the Madhya Pradesh police in Ujjain on Thursday, nearly a week after eight policemen in his pursuit were killed near Kanpur, exemplifies a crisis in Uttar Pradesh police. At the time of his arrest, Dubey had at least 60 cases, including murder, to his name. Since the July 3 ambush in his village, Dubey evidently travelled three states even as the UP police gunned down five of his accomplices, bulldozed his house, and arrested two policemen on the suspicion that they were his moles in the force. As evidence of the wanton short-circuiting of the rule of law in l?affaire Dubey ? the chilling ?encounter culture? and the alleged complicities within the system ? comes to light, the police now needs to ensure that Dubey has his day in court. That even criminals have a right to due process is a principle the UP administration has, by all accounts, been guilty of giving the go-by in recent times. Though the Supreme Court has declared encounter killings as unlawful, seniors ministers and the chief minister himself, have signalled their endorsement to this disturbing phenomenon, even touting it as a major achievement in office. Taking a cue from the apparent political sanction, senior police officials have publicly owned and celebrated encounter killings, forcing the National Human Rights Commission to issue notices to them.

The Dubey case has all the markings of a disquieting nexus that involves politicians, policemen and criminals. Bahubalis, as criminals often associated with politicians are known in UP and Bihar, have been an integral part of the political landscape in these states for decades. Adityanath had promised a clean-up of law and order in UP when he came to power, and his government even claims it as an achievement. However, a culture of encounters and police impunity appears to have been boosted in UP. An apparent disdain for due process has emboldened the police force to use excessive force against criminals and protesters alike ? the disproportionate police response and the stamping down of all protests during the anti-CAA mobilisations last year were part of the same pattern.

Now, the government will be watched on how it handles the Dubey case. The UP police must know, and if they don?t, they must be told that in a society governed by the rule of law, the death of policemen cannot be avenged by the encounters of criminals. Considering the scale and scope of the alleged crime and conspiracy, including the possible involvement of public officials, it will be prudent for the government to entrust the probe to an independent and impartial agency immediately.",Murky Vikas Dubey case is a test that UP government and police can ill afford to fail,The Indian Express,
59,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"It is surreal that the fugitive criminal Vikas Dubey, who surrendered to the Madhya Pradesh police at Ujjain on Thursday, is then shot dead by the UP police on Friday morning ? allegedly because he tried to snatch a gun and escape when the vehicle carrying him in a police convoy overturned at Kanpur (the only vehicle to do so).

Incidentally, the media, which was shadowing the convoy, was stopped 15 minutes before the incident. It is evident that the killing was nothing more than a brazen act of extra-judicial execution. It may not be shocking, but it is nothing if not condemnable.

Not many in UP would bat an eye at this gruesome shortcut of justice. Popular bloodlust for summary justice ? as witnessed last December when the Telangana police was feted for shooting dead the four accused in a veterinarian's rape-murder on Hyderabad?s outskirts ? continues to be fed by a political class that was complicit in Dubey?s crimes.

The extra-judicial execution cannot be justified on the grounds that Dubey?s men killed eight policemen. The Constitution gives everyone the right to a fair trial under Article 14, and Article 21 renders a fair trial as part of any individual?s guarantee of life and personal liberty.

An extra-judicial execution is unconstitutional. The absence of due process subverts not only the criminal justice system but democracy as well. It might sit well with a cynical populace impatient with the slow wheels of justice.

But it erodes the fabric of our democracy and society in ways that are much graver than an extra-judicial execution. One way is the manner of late in which the victims of riots are charged as the culprits, or in which dissenting students are deemed more anti-national than actual terrorists.

Vikas Dubey was a bad man. He had over 60 cases to his name including five in which he was directly accused of murder. In 2001, he reportedly killed a state minister ? inside a police station. Yet he would not have thrived for so long had it not been for the police-criminal-politician nexus that has existed for longer than most Indians have been alive.

Kunda MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya, for instance, is one of many notorious politicians with a long criminal record. In UP the politician-criminal nexus is so widespread that any Netflix crime serial is by default set in UP.

In Dubey?s case, there was much talk of how he could have spilled the beans on the high and mighty ? a former CM said if his vehicle had not toppled, the government would have ? and it is speculated that five of the 12 named in the police deaths FIR were ?encountered? because of such links.

Killing Dubey might have been an act of self-preservation by the UP police. In which case society must accept that Dubey?s extra-judicial execution is no panacea to UP?s (or India?s) law and order problems; it only preserves and perpetuates the dirty, lawless and corrupt status quo.","Vikas Dubey is dead, long live UP?s neta-thug net",Deccan Chronicle,
60,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"The UP police theory on why it killed Vikas Dubey doesn?t stand to reason. The politico-criminal nexus will never be exposed

UP gangster Vikas Dubey may not have anyone mourning his death in a stage-managed accident cum encounter, responsible as he was for many killings, the last being of eight policemen. But does this sit easy on the conscience of the police, which has put out the most outrageous and improbable theory of his attempt to escape, one that triggered it to open fire? Is it not its job to deliver the culprit for courts to decide? Does it not indicate that the political patrons of Dubey and their protector policemen had too much to lose had the don spilled details of the unholy politician-criminal nexus that has entrenched itself in the State in a mutually self-serving manner? Does this not damage Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath?s image of a no-nonsense leader with zero tolerance for corruption and mafia, for good, considering he was personally supervising Dubey?s case? Or is it that his individual will stands no chance in front of systemic imperatives, which his party, too, has endorsed? Dubey himself was sensing that he would be eliminated, what with the police announcing a bounty on his head and five of his aides killed in orchestrated scenarios. So he surrendered, to negotiate a longish jail term for the right to live. But his protectors and creators were scared that with all the media attention on his arrest, he could have just spilled the beans or leaked prized information. So they got rid of him. This haste is troublesome for the simple reason that had the police followed processes and built a solid case on his killing of their colleagues in Kanpur, they could have anyway got the death sentence for him. Even assuming that some among the forces had tipped Dubey about an impending raid, which he used as a trap to ambush the cops, the UP police could have used his past crimes to justify the severest penalty. Why did it feel so disadvantaged and compromised as to ignore the provisions of the law and shoot to kill? Unless the men in uniform were told to play executioner. The sad part is that the focus has now shifted from Dubey, the criminal, to Dubey, the victim of police excesses. And nobody is even discussing the heinous nature of his crimes. This, too, is then an equal travesty of justice.

According to the UP police, while Dubey was being transported back to the State, one of the cars in the convoy overturned. Taking advantage of the situation, he allegedly attempted to snatch a weapon and flee the scene, following which the police opened fire and shot him. If the narrative sounds familiar, that is because it is. Most of Dubey?s aides died in such ?encounters? after ?attacking? the police and trying to ?escape.? It matters little why the policemen ?conveniently? forgot to secure their weapons as per rules, did not handcuff Dubey or how he managed to escape from an upturned car with all doors shut. The police theorists also forgot to factor how a car that skids on a smooth tarmac doesn?t leave tyre marks. In the end, many questions will be left hanging like aerosols that disintegrate beyond a certain point in time. Who were the political leaders who promoted the mobster?s criminal empire and his clout? Which all policemen in the force are in cahoots with criminals? The fact that deputy SP Devendra Mishra, who was among the eight policemen killed, had warned his seniors of Dubey?s hold over the justice system but was ignored speaks a lot about the don?s clout. Which netas are involved with criminals in the State? Dubey, who has been patronised by the ruling BJP and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) at various times, had of late tried to curry favour back with the BJP. Apart from intensifying caste wars for votebank consolidation, he was also a quick facilitator of land and business deals that political parties, their sponsors and bureaucrats found attractive. So, who is the UP Government trying to protect? India is a democracy after all and even criminals with such intimidating rap sheets like Dubey?s have a right to justice, representation and being heard in a court of law. Besides the Supreme Court has declared encounter killings as unlawful. But it is very obvious that the Adityanath administration and senior Ministers have given their tacit approval to this ?encounter culture? which abounds in the State as does police impunity. And with the killing of Dubey, one wonders if Adityanath is indeed serious about flushing out criminals and cleaning up the police at the same time. If we do not break the politico-police-criminal axis, cleansing is not possible. In a society governed by the rule of law, the death of a policeman cannot be avenged by encounters of criminals. Considering the scale of Dubey?s crimes and the involvement of Government officials and politicians, the State Government should have entrusted the probe to an independent and impartial agency immediately after the arrest of the don and his henchmen. But it seems the Government, too, is trying to protect someone, somewhere and has given the police a carte blanche. Will we ever know?",Encounter the truth,The Pioneer,
61,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"Vikas Dubey is dead. On Thursday, when he was arrested in Ujjain, this newspaper argued that his arrest must mark the beginning ? not the end ? of the story about the nexus between politics and crime in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and a broken administrative and police system. But there appear to have been forces which did not want that story told. On Friday morning, in highly mysterious circumstances, Dubey died, and so did the story he may have told.

It is important to reiterate first principles here. Dubey was a gang lord; his list of crimes was long; he allegedly led the attack and killing on eight policemen in Kanpur last week. Such a man deserved to be punished for his crimes. But India prides itself on the rule of law. When a crime is allegedly committed, a process kicks in. The perpetrator is arrested, contingent on judicial sanction. Suspects are questioned. Evidence is amassed. Interrogations are conducted. A case is built up. The court examines the evidence and testimonies; the defendant has a right to legal defence. On the merits of the case, based on the law, the judiciary hands down its decision, which can then be appealed against. In a civilised society, this process is undertaken, not just because the guilty is presumed to be innocent until convicted, but because this is the only way to sustain the legitimacy of the system and prevent arbitrary exercise of power. Even Ajmal Kasab, caught red-handed in the 26/11 attacks, got a trial.

In UP, there appears to be a pattern where this process is, often, not followed. There have been a spate of extrajudicial killings ? encounters, in popular parlance ? since the current government took office in 2017. This is attributed to a stern approach where patience for due process is limited. Even before Friday, this impatience with process, the desire to satiate the thirst for instant justice, as well as, more controversially, ensure Dubey did not speak about his political and bureaucratic linkages were being seen as factors that would cut short his life. The circumstances of his death ? he was shifted into another vehicle before the shoot-out; journalists following the convoy were stopped before the encounter took place; the absence of evidence to show how his car overturned ? will only add motive to mystery. If UP wants to set an example, it must institute an independent probe on the manner of Dubey?s killing and his entire network. India may have one less criminal today, but it has also fallen short of its own principles.",Vikas Dubey?s mysterious death ,The Hindustan Times,
62,Vikas Dubey Encounter,"Murders by the police ingenuously called ?encounter? deaths have been turned into policy by the UP chief minister
Gullibility is not one of the seven deadly sins, or the Indian people might have been condemned for it. For it is not just Vikas Dubey, responsible for the murders of eight policemen, who was killed in an ?encounter? when he allegedly tried to escape while being transported by the police from Ujjain to Kanpur, but also five of his co-accused, who were killed in less publicized ?encounters? in the six days that Dubey remained elusive. The events from the arrest ? was it surrender? ? to the death ? which car turned over? ? of a criminal accused of numerous murders long before the police killings yet running free with barely concealed political backing are enveloped in a fog of clashing claims. It is remarkable that police officers, not just politicians, are unworried that their statements may sound incredible or contradictory, or their acts may be revealing ? the media were stopped from following the police entourage just before the accident that made the encounter possible ? because the Uttar Pradesh government seems convinced of the Indian people?s gullibility. Any old fairytale will do, even an oft-repeated one.

There may be another reason. Murders by the police ingenuously called ?encounter? deaths have been turned into policy by the UP chief minister. In February 2018, government records show that the police were conducting four encounters daily, targeting those they, or the state, decided were guilty of something. That is a crime. Completely bypassing the law, the Constitution and judicial processes in the name of establishing order has created a culture where the police have probably forgotten all procedures except killing. A day before Dubey?s death, a petition in the Supreme Court asked that his security be ensured during arrest, citing the encounter deaths of his five followers. The Supreme Court?s earlier directions in case of encounter deaths are irrelevant in UP. If Dubey?s reported closeness to people in power led to his death before being brought to court, that is a manifestation of the politician-criminal link and the criminal-turned-politician phenomenon that the courts and the Election Commission have been fighting against. But as frightening is the fact that in UP no one objects to encounter killings; fear and violence have poisoned people?s perception. There is nothing innocent or foolish about this pretence of gullibility.",Free run: The Vikas Dubey killing,The Telegraph,
63,Triple Talaq bill becomes a law,"Making triple talaq a criminal offence is unnecessary and possibly counter-productive
The Centre?s proposal to make instant triple talaq an offence punishable with three-year imprisonment and a fine is an unnecessary attempt to convert a civil wrong into a criminal act. By a three-two majority, the Supreme Court has already declared, and correctly, that the practice of talaq-e-biddat, or instant divorce of a Muslim woman by uttering the word ?talaq? thrice, is illegal and unenforceable. While two judges in the majority said the practice was arbitrary and, therefore, unconstitutional, the third judge ruled that it was illegal because it was contrary to Islamic tenets. Its consequence is that the husband?s marital obligations remain, regardless of his intention in pronouncing it. When Parliament enacts a law to give effect to the judicial invalidation of talaq-e-biddat, it must primarily ensure protection to Muslim women against its use. Although the details are not yet available, the proposed Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017, appears to have provisions for maintenance or subsistence allowance to the wife and children in the event of triple talaq being pronounced. It seeks to preserve the woman?s entitlement to custody of her children. While these are welcome and necessary features of a law aimed to protect the rights of Muslim women against arbitrary divorce, it hardly requires iteration that the civil character of these aspects of marital law must be preserved.

Instant triple talaq is viewed as sinful and improper by a large section of the community itself. Therefore, there can be no dispute about the need to protect Muslim women against the practice. But it is also well established that criminalising something does not have any deterrent effect on its practice. That there have been 66 cases of its use after the Supreme Court verdict only underscores the need for protecting women against desertion and abandonment, but is it justified to send someone to jail? Also, the fine amount under consideration could as well be awarded as maintenance or subsistence allowance. The All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen president, Asaduddin Owaisi, has argued in a letter to the Union Law Minister that there is no need for a fresh criminal provision when existing laws, under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code or provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, already allow the prosecution of a husband for inflicting physical or mental cruelty, emotional and economic abuse, and for deprivation of financial resources. Regardless of whether instant talaq would fall under any of these forms of cruelty or domestic violence, criminalising it risks defeating the objective of preserving the husband?s legal obligations, and the payment of maintenance. The Centre would do well to reconsider its draft and limit its scope to providing relief to women, instead of creating a new offence out of a civil matter.",Divorce as crime: on instant triple talaq,The Hindu,
64,Triple Talaq bill becomes a law,"The passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill criminalising instant oral talaq in the Rajya Sabha fulfils a BJP electoral promise. The party?s Hindutva base and even a number of Muslims opposed to the writ of religious leaders and personal laws reigning supreme in their community have welcomed the moment. By prescribing three years imprisonment for Muslim men who pronounce the talaq-e-biddat, the law sticks out with rough edges for treating divorce as a criminal offence.

From a system which gave archaic personal laws a long rope for decades to now criminalising practices like triple talaq that it fostered, India is veritably swinging between extremes. The old order had to change, but it is unfortunate that the new law failed to strike a balance. Personal laws gave religious leaders disproportionate influence and denied many people, especially women, the benefits of living in a free society and under meaningful protection of the state. By overriding personal laws, government is indeed doing Muslim women a world of good but in failing to treat triple talaq as a civil offence, as in any other messy divorce case, it may conceivably end up doing more harm than good to the woman.

A legal challenge in Supreme Court is certain to raise issues like proportionality: whether the severity of punishment befits the seriousness of the crime and whether there are less onerous ways of achieving the legislation?s goals. In a sense the social and political cost of not having a Uniform Civil Code, which would have been in tune with the secular ethos of the country, is showing. From Congress ?appeasement? of minorities ? or to be more precise clerics within minority communities in the hope they would deliver a ?vote bank? ? the pendulum has now swung to the other extreme where, under a Hindutva-oriented government, the law appears to have a punitive edge for Muslim men.

In a contrary scenario, a UCC would have united the country in true fashion where citizens irrespective of religion would follow the same laws for marriage, divorce, succession, etc. This government has a manifesto that promises UCC and a mandate that can make it happen. It must bite the bullet while earning trust by upholding, rather than debunking, other aspects of secularism as well.",Make it win-win: Personal laws permitting triple talaq had to go but criminalising it spawns new injustices,The times of India,

The issue of triple talaq is definitely real in India. For decades, many Muslim women activists have been engaged in a struggle to change discriminatory family laws. (Illustration by: Suvajit Dey)
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, now a law, has been hailed as a victory for gender justice by Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and other supporters of the Bill. The question is: Will this law really provide justice to Muslim women? To answer it, we need to inspect the Bill?s content as well as the intention with which it has been brought in.

The issue of triple talaq is definitely real in India. For decades, many Muslim women activists have been engaged in a struggle to change discriminatory family laws. The agenda had been holistic, covering not only one form of talaq but traditions like halala and polygamy and demanding a more comprehensive ?gender just law?. The intention was to bring Muslim women into the gamut of secular family laws, which are applicable to all other women from all religions in India. However, the current Act is a far cry from such an objective.

The Bill has many flaws. Its first provision says: ?Any pronouncement of talaq by a Muslim husband upon his wife, by words either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever shall be void and illegal.? In fact, such a practice had already been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in its judgment on August 21, 2017. The SC had sought legislation in support of its judgment and the law would have been sufficient with just this one section. However, the government has included unwarranted criminal provisions in the Bill.

The next provision talks about punishment of the husband with imprisonment up to three years and a fine. This is, in itself, a contradiction. If triple talaq has no legal validity (by virtue of the SC verdict), how can you punish it? Also, the personal laws of all communities are civil matters. This is the first time that criminal provisions are being laid out in matters of marriage and divorce.

The next provision talks about the husband providing a subsistence allowance. How can a jailed person provide money? Further, the woman in a case of triple talaq, will receive no support from her in-laws, since she will be seen as being responsible for putting her husband in jail.

There are existing laws which protect Hindu women and those from other communities in cases of domestic violence. Instead of this new law, in case a husband insists on triple talaq by unlawful means, he could have been booked under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. A common gender-just law could be a solution, rather than separate religion-specific laws. The BJP has batted for a common civil code since decades. Ironically, when the time came, they opted for a sharia-based law.

Currently, there is a sense of apprehension in the Muslim community, given the backdrop of mob lynching and the talk by political leaders of imposing the National Register of Citizens not only in the Northeast but across the country. The fear is that the triple talaq law will be used as a tool to harass men from the community.

The way in which the Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha is also a concern. Many members who opposed it in the debate helped the BJP by remaining absent during voting. This was irresponsible and shows apathy towards issues concerning Muslims.

This law will only serve the political purpose of the BJP. Affected Muslim women will continue to suffer. In fact, the law will add to their suffering.","Instead of a separate law on triple talaq, Centre should have framed a just law for all",The Indian Express,
66,Triple Talaq bill becomes a law,"The practice of instant triple talaq would not have been considered just or fair by anyone. The Supreme Court had declared it to be un-Islamic, arbitrary and not an integral part of religious practice two years ago. Hence the fact that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government got the Muslim women (protection of rights on marriage) bill, 2019 passed by both Houses of Parliament can be perceived as ensuring for women of that faith a form of justice of which they had been cruelly deprived. It is ungracious to accuse Narendra Modi?s government of concealed intentions on the occasion of this important step. The present government?s decisiveness must be placed in the context of democratically-minded society?s indisputable failure: it has for more than 70 years deplored the practice of instant triple talaq without doing anything about it. Either the fear of losing votes or the hesitation to approach what was projected as part of personal law appeared to prevent earlier governments from addressing the injustice traditionally faced by a section of the electorate. This failure in upholding the principle of equity in a democratic State was nothing short of opportunistic.

The confusion seems to have persisted. The Opposition?s objections to the instant triple talaq bill in its present form are based on the provision that penalizes the pronouncement of instant triple talaq with imprisonment and a fine. This leaves the family helpless. Those opposing the provision see it as a way to destroy families of the minority community by using its own practices and imprisoning its men, while the assumption behind the bill is that the practice cannot be ended without criminalizing it. Had the parties opposing the bill been serious, they would have had a chance if they had opposed it together in the Rajya Sabha, or at least insisted, as some suggested, that it be taken to a review committee. By walking out, abstaining and remaining absent, a number of parties opposing the bill and individual members of the Opposition made sure that the bill was passed. In other words, the objections were a show, as though the parties that walked out or the members who were absent wanted to put their protest against the criminalization of instant triple talaq on record without taking the risk of being identified as those who opposed the bill.

67,GDP collapse post Lockdown,"The inevitable has happened. India?s GDP suffered its steepest contraction on record in the April-June quarter, as output shrank 23.9% from a year earlier, provisional data show. It is evident that the stringent COVID-19 lockdowns in force through the first third of the quarter, and substantially in May, hollowed out demand. Private consumption spending, which accounts for almost 60% of GDP, contracted 26.7% as consumers abjured almost all discretionary spending. And exports, which contribute to a fifth of GDP and reflect overseas demand for Indian goods and services, shrank by nearly 20%. Investment activity was the worst-hit, collapsing 47% and shrinking in share of GDP to about 22% from 32% a year earlier as larger businesses conserved cash and refrained from any capital spending in the face of uncertainty, and smaller firms prioritised survival. Across the real economy, every single industry and services sector shrank with the solitary exception of agriculture, which grew 3.4% and outpaced the year earlier quarter?s 3% expansion. Construction suffered the most, plunging 50%, followed by the omnibus services category ? trade, hotels, communication, transport and broadcasting ? which shrank 47%, hit by the pandemic-linked restrictions. Manufacturing too took a severe beating, contracting 39% as demand for products deemed non-essential evaporated, and factories, even after reopening, struggled to run amid shortages of labour and added safety norms.

It was left to the government to keep the bottom from falling out on demand as the Centre?s pandemic mitigation expenditure helped expand its consumption spending by 16.4% year-on-year and softened the overall blow to GDP. However, with the fiscal deficit already having exceeded the full-year?s budgeted target in just the first four months, and revenue receipts impacted by the economic contraction, the government is unlikely to maintain a similar trend in expenditure growth over the next three quarters. Unless, of course, it is prepared to forsake its vaunted fiscal conservatism and finds innovative ways to mobilise resources. The still rising trajectory of new COVID-19 infections and a high level of job losses and income erosion are also sure to retard any recovery in momentum. If the latest survey-based data from IHS Markit show manufacturing PMI for August signalling growth for the first time in five months, the same researcher?s findings also stress that ?job shedding continues at a strong rate? in the industry. Equally significantly, the output numbers which are expected to undergo revision given the acknowledged difficulties in collecting data, do not capture a swathe of informal sector activity that was severely impacted. Agriculture too faces headwinds in the form of higher-than-ideal rainfall in August in several key crop growing regions in western and central India and with the impact of recent farm market ordinances yet to play out, it may be a while before the end of the tunnel is sighted.",Inevitable collapse: on steepest contraction of GDP,The Hindu,

The economy badly tanked in April, when there was a complete lockdown. Even the agriculture sector, which works out in the open and could have continued normally, was adversely impacted due to collapse in demand and freezing of trade and transportation. Arrivals in North Indian mandis had fallen to half of what they were in April 2019. Floriculture, horticulture, vegetables, poultry and milk are some of the commodities which suffered. Though the rabi crop was a record, agriculture production as a whole would have risen little in April-May.

Production of essentials was permitted during the lockdown, but fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms faced a decline. Most people could not go to work, so roads were empty and offices and factories were shut. Government offices were also closed and only the essential administration and police were functional. All in all, the economy would have been working at less than 25% of its level in April 2019.

As the lockdown was eased in stages from May, activity started to recover. But it still could not have been more than 40% of the level in May 2019. In June with Unlock 1, more activity was allowed but by all accounts many services were not allowed and this sector constitutes 55% of the GDP. So, the economy could not have been working at more than 60%.

In brief, during the period of April to June, the economy was down about 57% compared to the level in 2019. Even if one assumes very optimistically that the economy was functioning at 40%, 50% and 70% of the last year?s levels in April, May and June 2020, the decline in GDP for this period would be 47% and not 23.9%. Why is the official data not reflecting this decline in the GDP?

The reason is, as this author has been pointing out since the time of demonetisation, that the unorganised sector decline is not captured in the GDP data. It is not captured in the annual GDP data and even less so in the quarterly data which has been released since 1996. In fact, the quarterly data does not even fully capture the organised sector. It is based on very limited data like the Index of Industrial Production, a few hundred corporate sector companies whose reports are released, railways traffic and banking data. All these represent the organised sector only. Agriculture is the only component of the unorganised sector whose data is used. So, the rate of growth of -23.9% announced now is largely the rate of decline of the organised sector.

The unorganised sector is 94% of employment and 45% of output of the economy. Agriculture is its biggest component and its data is available but for the rest, the data is unavailable. It is collected once in five years and in between it is assumed that the organised sector can be used to proxy the unorganised sector also. This is not true after a shock like demonetisation or the lockdown.

The unorganised sector other than agriculture was hit the hardest by the lockdown. Units here do not have much working capital and this gets exhausted as work stops. Demand for its output also drops sharply as people are confined to homes. These reasons also prevented this sector from reviving after the easing of lockdown. If the organised sector declined by the official figure of 23.9%, the unorganised sector would have declined by 70% 80% during Q1.

The official document giving the data for Q1, titled ?Estimates Of Gross Domestic Product For The First Quarter, (April-June) Of 2020-21? says, ?There has been an impact on the economic activities as well as on the data collection mechanisms. ?the usual data sources were substituted by alternatives like GST??.

This lets the cat out of the bag. Data was hardly collected for April and May due to the lockdown. The data for Index of Industrial Production and Consumer Price Index could not be obtained. Companies were given time till September to file their quarterly reports. GST payment due in March was allowed to be postponed to June. Consequently, only the companies doing well or not too badly announced their results. Use of this data will then give an upward bias to the growth rate. Similarly, use of June data for GST will give an upward bias to the growth rates.

So, the official document says, ?Estimates are therefore likely to undergo revisions ??.

Clearly, the figure of decline of 23.9% represents only the organised sector and even this will be revised downwards. Revision of quarterly estimates of growth has been routine in the last one year and this year will be no exception given the huge uncertainty in data. It also portends that the next quarter will also be dismal given the poor consumer sentiment, low business confidence and continued difficulties in the unorganised sector and the services sectors.

India has become the worst performing economy among the G20 nations in April to June quarter. Britain is the next worst at -20.4% and China is the best performing with a positive rate of growth of 3.2%. Within one quarter, China turned around from -6.8% decline to a positive rate of growth. Why is India impacted far more than other G20 countries?

First, the lockdown was not properly implemented, so the benefit of lockdown could not be obtained. The lockdown is being eased while the number of cases are rising rapidly. The first round of attack is proliferating and the number of infections are increasing creating huge uncertainty. Repeated local lockdowns have had to be ordered, which disrupts production. Second, as mentioned above, there is a very large unorganised sector unlike other big economies. People in this sector are poor and cannot cope with a crisis. The authorities have ignored this factor.

Third, a large number of people are alienated from the system and lack faith in the authorities. So, they flout official pronouncements. Some people believe that this is a manufactured crisis and the authorities are fooling them. Often, one sees people going around without masks and not maintaining physical distancing. This enables the virus to proliferate. This is also the lesson from countries that have been successful in controlling the spread of the disease ? the moment there is laxity, the disease starts proliferating again.

Thus, there are long-term factors which make India?s situation worse than that of other major economies. Even if one accepts the official data, the Indian economy is in depression and not just recession. It will take a long time to get out of it ? till expectations change. For that, the government needs to change its stance from cautious to bold.",What the 23.9% Drop in Q1 GDP Tells ? and Doesn?t Tell ? Us About the Economy ,The Wire,
69,GDP collapse post Lockdown,"There is no doubt that COVID-19 has engulfed the entire world in just a few months. The closure of industrial units and the complete halt of air, rail and road traffic added to the woes of an economy under strain. But the government had received several warnings about the looming crisis.

The first five years of the Narendra Modi government were marked by two major steps ? demonetisation and GST
The politics of the RSS-BJP combine is responsible for the current state of the economy ? the unprecedented decline of the GDP to -23.9 per cent ? and the immiseration of the country?s toiling people. Barely a year ago, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the goal of a $5-trillion economy by 2024-2025 was realisable. Last week, the FM invoked the notion of an ?act of God? while shrugging off the Centre?s responsibility of payments to states under GST.

There is no doubt that COVID-19 has engulfed the entire world in just a few months. The closure of industrial units and the complete halt of air, rail and road traffic added to the woes of an economy under strain. But the government had received several warnings about the looming crisis. The CPI had warned it about a recession and pointed out that the so-called reforms ? commercialisation of education and health, privatisation of public sector undertakings, reckless liberalisation to allow foreign capital in virtually every sector ? are not the solution to what ails the economy.

The first five years of the Narendra Modi government were marked by two major steps ? demonetisation and GST. Demonetisation ruined the informal sector, caused immense misery to the poor and failed in curbing corruption, terrorism and black money ? its ostensible aims. GST delivered a blow to the MSME sector, cut into the revenues of states, undermined the federal spirit of the country?s polity and made states dependent on the Centre?s mercy. Today, when state governments unable to pay salaries, the Centre advises them to take loans from the RBI.

State governments had to give up 60-70 per cent of their taxing powers, including the entire VAT regime, to usher in GST. They did so on the Centre?s assurance of compensation for the shortfall due to GST collection for five years.

The global financial meltdown of 2008 exposed the realities of the neoliberal order. During the debate on this issue, the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh claimed that the fundamentals of the Indian economy were strong enough to withstand the impact of the crisis. They also acknowledged the role of public sector banks and financial institutions. This crisis was triggered by the collapse of the two financial institutions because of excessive lending and failure in getting the loans repaid. NPAs are today the major problem faced by the banking sector. The Modi government has failed to take tangible action to recover these loans.

The COVID-19 lockdown was declared in the last week of March, even though India reported its first infection at the end of January. The government was busy making preparations for US President Donald Trump?s India visit. The BJP and RSS were aggressively breaking anti-CAA protests across the country, especially in Delhi, and polarising the people on communal lines.

Pseudo nationalism is being used to restrain resistance to such misrule, to stifle dissent. The federal character of the polity is being destroyed. We know of the almost summary abrogation of Article 370. The Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to the Constitution?s secular character. The dilution of reservations for marginalised people shows the government?s lack of commitment to the principles of social justice enshrined in the Constitution. At the same time, there is no let-up in the atrocities against people from SC/ST communities. Despite daily COVID-19 cases crossing 70,000 and opposition from many state governments, students are being forced to appear in all-India examinations like the JEE and NEET.

Faced with an insensitive government, the people should not be made to feel insecure. The Left should mobilise people and lead them in the struggle against this pro-corporate and communal government. At a time when right-wing ideologues declare that there is no opposition in the country, the Left should unite all secular democratic forces.","From mismanaging Covid to worsening economic distress, government missteps abound",The Indian Express,

Apples are causing Kashmiri farmers much distress as Rs 8,000 crore worth low-hanging fruits are inaccessible and need serious governmental help to pluck them and send them off to nationwide markets. It?s fascinating that the fall of one apple from a tree may have changed the very landscape of man?s knowledge about his planet and the Universe manifold when Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity as a major force of Nature, deducing it from the fact that a falling object wouldn?t otherwise start moving from rest. This was in the 17th century. Mankind has come a long way since Einstein?s genius postulated the Theory of Relativity in the 20th century.

The wisdom of at least one BJP minister doesn?t seem to have absorbed the lessons of history well enough to be able to distinguish between apples and oranges, or between apple and Apple, the corporate he is wooing to ease India?s economic slowdown. If not for maths, the bedrock of economics, we can?t distinguish where we stand as a people and know what our GDP is. The economy is now seen in freefall but, unlike Newton?s apple, not from gravity. A somewhat confused minister couldn?t distinguish between these two great mathematicians. But this is par for the course: he is convinced mathematics itself isn?t worth pursuing.

71,GDP collapse post Lockdown,"The first half of the fiscal year 2020-21 ends today. The year started under a nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25. While most lockdown restrictions have been withdrawn, especially in the second quarter, the economy is far from normal. India?s GDP suffered an annual contraction of 23.9% in the June quarter. Most private and institutional forecasts predict an annual contraction in the range of 5-10% this year. Neither the government, nor the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has a projection for this year?s GDP. In an interview to this newspaper, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman refused to speculate on the annual performance of the economy while noting that the fall in the first quarter?s GDP was quite substantial.

At a time when the economy continues to face a difficult challenge, the government has opened at least two avoidable political fronts which will disrupt a co-ordinated response on the economic front. The first is the GST compensation cess payment controversy with the states. The second is the political showdown on the three agriculture reform bills. It is unlikely that it will have to backtrack from its position on both these issues. There is also the question of policy interventions generating confidence and clarity. The government has banned onion exports even as it celebrates its agricultural reforms as giving unprecedented freedom to the farmers. RBI?s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting was abruptly postponed a day before it was supposed to begin; the government is yet to appoint external members to MPC.

There is a consensus that a process of sequential recovery is underway in the economy and GDP growth rates will be higher than what they were in the first quarter. There are two reasons why this is not good enough. First, the challenge is to catapult GDP to pre-pandemic levels as soon as possible. Most experts do not see this happening despite easing of lockdown restrictions. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index has been increasing continuously in August and September (except a slight fall in the week ending September 27). Yet, Nomura economists continue to project a contraction in every quarter of the current fiscal year. Second, with Covid-19 showing no signs of miraculously going away, both consumer and business sentiment will remain subdued. There is clearly a strong case to be made for a second stimulus, something the finance minister said she was open to in the interview.",The economy going forward,The Hindustan Times,
72,GDP collapse post Lockdown,"The Modi government has tried very hard to persuade all TV viewers that we are not in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic mismanagement disaster.

The Union finance minister?s delivered a five-part presentation on a plan for economic revival. But as Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said on an NDTV show, what everyone was waiting for, was a package for economic survival or relief funds.

This plan to pump up the economy through loans and privatisation at this time has met with criticism from independent thinking industrialists to economists, farmer associations to industrial trade unions, and across the opposition parties. Irrespective of different ideologies or vocations, everyone seems to agree that the economy cannot be jumpstarted when the urban and rural workers of our country have no food or cash and the families in the middle to lowest sections of the economy have lost jobs and are indebted.

But the central government appears to be in denial. 

The government has recycled many of its pre-coronavirus economic policies as its new Atmanirbhar Abhiyan (self-reliance movement) package.

Support to MSME, privatisation of the mining sector, expansion of airports, ports and highways and space exploration were the government?s key announcements in its 2020 Budget.

Now, these policies being pushed to increase the economic GDP at this time of global recession and anti-globalisation may end up costing the Indian public far more than it gives us. This government, which administered shocks to the economy with demonetization and GST, has not been known to count the cost of its policies. But our society, that is highly unequal and where different sections experience ?the economy? is vastly different ways, cannot afford these risky proposals. 

It is doubtful if anyone in India still needs convincing that after two terms of the UPA and one of the NDA, the cache of achievements of neoliberal growth since 1991 has disappeared into the Cayman islands or into NPAs or into the wealth of families of the Forbes list of billionaires.

Oxfam?s report of 2020 stated that the wealth of 63 Indian billionaires was higher than the Union Budget of 2018-19. We have been in a long phase of jobless growth and our spending on public infrastructure and services has been shrinking. As stated by experts studying urban growth, this is a state of ?accumulation without development?.

This has occurred along with a spike in the wilful, legitimised destruction of environmental resources. Those who say our choice is between growth and environment are wrong. Our governments have weaponised growth against the environment and its citizens. 

Persisting with such a growth model will now be harmful to humanity. Communities and movements in many parts of the world, who care about the earth and its inhabitants are demanding greener, slower and smaller economies that value social indicators over GDP, cooperation over competition, and leisure, creativity and connectedness at the centre of our social organisation. Why haven?t we seen such proposals in India?

The short answer may be that we are still in relief mode as our governments are yet to make adequate resources available for the needy like the stranded migrants, farmers and fishers who have lost their produce and the growing number of unemployed people.

These are certainly the issues deserving all attention due to the unimaginable levels of hunger and deprivation. But the lack of bold post COVID-19 proposals may also be because we have many economists who believe that India is too poor to shun the prevailing growth models.

We also have only a few economists who are willing to see beyond the model of a welfare state that is underpinned by a highly extractive economy. It is for this reason that shaping a post-pandemic world needs the full participation of activists, scholars and community organisations who can root the economy within a just society.

As members of an interconnected society we need to dictate our terms and conditions to the economic system rather than be controlled by its default logics. ",Why the Economic Crisis Shouldn't Become an Opportunity for More GDP Talk,The Telegraph,
73,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"Allahabad HC order quashing Dr. Kafeel Khan?s detention exposes state persecution
If ever any evidence was needed that Dr. Kafeel Khan, a government doctor from Gorakhpur, has been a victim of state persecution, the Allahabad High Court has provided that. Its 42-page order has laid bare the malefic manner in which the doctor was detained under the National Security Act (NSA) on February 13, 2020, shortly after he was granted bail in an earlier case. Dr. Khan, suspended in 2017 after a severe shortage of oxygen cylinders took a deadly toll among children admitted to the encephalitis ward in the Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital, Gorakhpur, was arrested on January 29, 2020, for an address to students of Aligarh Muslim University last December. His speech, which contained scathing criticism of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and its discriminatory nature, was deemed inflammatory weeks after he had made it. The High Court has now found that far from inciting Muslims, the speech, taken in its entirety, does not disclose any effort to promote hatred or violence; and nowhere does it threaten peace in Aligarh. The DM, Aligarh, the court says, used selective reading of some phrases and ignored its true intent while passing the detention order. No reasonable man, it says, would have come to the conclusion about the speech that the DM did. The grounds for detention under NSA provided nothing that indicated any attempt by Dr. Khan to disturb peace and tranquillity between the speech in December and his detention in February. The inevitable inference is that the NSA was invoked only to avoid releasing him following the Chief Judicial Magistrate court?s order granting him bail. The process to invoke the NSA itself began only after the bail order, the Bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Saumitra Dayal Singh noted.

The use of stringent national security laws against political dissenters, in the absence of any appeal to violence, is something to be condemned in all cases. However, there is something perverse about the resort to preventive detention just to frustrate bail orders. In particular, the authorities have shown excessive zeal in dealing with Dr. Khan. In 2017, he was arrested on charges of negligence and corruption even though circumstances indicated his strenuous efforts to ensure continuous oxygen supply. He spent months in prison before an inquiry absolved him of the charges of negligence and corruption, but was found to have been engaging in private practice. The paediatrician?s suspension is yet to be revoked. Even though the verdict gives him relief, it comes after he spent seven months in jail. And his case will some day go to trial. The case of Dr. Khan is poor advertisement for India?s democratic credentials, for it brings to light its propensity to criminalise dissent, single out individuals for persecution and display a general disregard for basic rights.",Dissent and detention: On Dr. Kafeel Khan,The Hindu,
74,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"The Allahabad High Court?s order quashing the detention of outspoken Dr Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act was a slap on the face of the UP administration that had him imprisoned for months. While the local district magistrate (DM) Chandra Bhushan Singh invoked the NSA citing a ?provocative? speech Dr Khan delivered at the Bab-e-Syed gate of the Aligarh Muslim University against the Citizenship Amendment Act last year, the court found nothing objectionable in the address.

Instead, the Bench said the speech actually gave a call for national integrity. It hauled the DM over the coals for his selective reading of the address, ignoring its true intent. The administration used every dilatory tactic, the Bench pointed out, like providing radiograms of the extension of his detention under the NSA without giving him a hard copy of the order that would have enabled him to seek judicial redress.

Besides, to satisfy the Constitutional mandate that a detenue must be provided adequate material to seek relief at the earliest, Dr Khan was given a compact disk of his AMU speech but without an instrument to play it! Neither was he given a copy of the speech?s transcript. The NSA was invoked against him by the DM in February, days after a local court granted him bail following his arrest in late December at the Mumbai airport.

Incidentally, the court?s decision came a day before the Union Cabinet cleared an ambitious plan to reform the bureaucracy and build capacity to make government employees ?more creative, proactive, professional and technology-enabled?. But would that training reform the likes of the Aligarh DM, who clearly had an axe to grind against Dr Khan? Politicisation of the bureaucracy is the elephant in the room.

Reforms that sidestep political meddling cannot fully repair the nation?s steel frame, which is how Sardar Patel had described the civil services. The DM apparently invoked the NSA because people can be detained under it without charges for up to 12 months. His abuse of the draconian law reignited the debate on whether it should exist at all in a progressive democracy. After all the opprobrium, the UP government ought to take action against the DM; else it could be accused of being his instigator.",Dr Kafeel Khan case a litmus test for bureaucratic reform,The times of India,
75,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"At a time that the Supreme Court is being seen as a muzzled watchdog silent in the face of rampant rise in hate crimes and unconscionable negligence, it is the high courts that have emerged as a beacon, offering limited succour to the persecuted. This time around, it has come to the rescue of two brave citizens.

Allahabad high court chief justice Govind Mathur has to his credit a long line of recent orders upholding fundamental rights. Many of them have come in suo motu cases.

 

It was Justice Mathur?s bench, for instance, which directed the Uttar Pradesh government in March this year to remove hoardings erected at public places displaying photos and addresses of alleged Citizenship (Amendment) Act dissenters.

And it is his bench that ordered the release of Gorakhpur paediatrician Kafeel Khan, setting aside the Yogi Adityanath government?s detention order against him, declaring his speech at Aligarh Muslim University campus on December 13, 2019, a call to unity and national integration.

Most importantly, it ruled the invocation of the National Security Act in the case two full months later as unsustainable. Khan had been granted bail in February but was kept in jail under the provisions of the NSA.

However, anti-CAA activist Devangana Kalita, who was granted bail by Delhi high court judge Suresh Kumar Kait who ruled that her presence in the protests at Jafrabad Metro station on the night of February 22 failed to prove that she had instigated Muslim women to violence or given a hate speech, will continue to remain in jail. She is in custody under another FIR filed under the draconian UAPA and has been refused bail in that case.

In his speech at AMU, Khan, whose family has been made the target of miscreant attacks, had called attention to the appalling absence of doctors and basic infrastructure in heartlands, and he had also mentioned that as a member of his community he refused to be browbeaten into silence.

He had criticised the impunity with which a labourer was killed in Rajasthan in 2017, simply for being Muslim.

In February, Khan?s own uncle became the victim of a shooting. The courts should compensate Khan for the sufferings that he has endured and the months that he has spent in jail ? in 2017, too, he was harassed by the same administration for exposing medical negligence. A rational and pluralistic polity should heed his views.
",A whistleblower?s vindication,The Asian age,
76,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"The Allahabad High Court has done well to set aside the detention of Kafeel Khan, a doctor at Gorakhpur?s BRD Medical College and Hospital, under the National Security Act and order the UP government to release him ?forthwith?. Khan has been in jail for nearly seven months, after the NSA was slapped on him for delivering an allegedly ?provocative speech? at a protest by students against the discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens in Aligarh Muslim University in December last year. The High Court said the speech was ?a call for national integrity and unity?, and did not mirror ?any effort to promote hatred or violence?. The two-judge bench described the doctor?s detention under NSA, imposed two months after the speech was delivered, as ?bad? in law, and based on ?selective reading and selective mention of few phrases from the speech ignoring its true intent?. A complete reading of the speech does not disclose any effort to promote hatred or violence, the Court said.

Clearly, due process was violated in Khan?s arrest, in the subsequent slapping of the NSA, and his extended detention. Unfortunately, this is part of a building pattern ? of draconian laws being mis-used by the state to cramp the citizen?s right to free speech and dissent, even as a quiescent court mostly looks on, or away. In Kedar Nath Singh, 1962, the Supreme Court had ruled that incitement to public disorder or violence was key to judging a speech as seditious. Yet, in recent times, state authorities have frequently invoked the provision to criminalise free speech and clamp down on dissent, with the judiciary, especially the lower courts, more often than not giving the state the benefit of doubt and delay. This newspaper has scrutinised 10 cases involving free speech that came before the Supreme Court since January this year and found that in four of those cases, in which the court upheld the right to free speech or gave relief, the state and the petitioner had argued on the same side ? that is, the court gave no relief to the petitioner in the other six cases where the Centre was the defendant and objected.

The Allahabad HC deserves credit for breaking this disquieting pattern. Its order provides a template for other courts to follow in cases that involve the fundamental rights of citizens and their encroachment by a state armed with repressive and outdated laws. This is especially crucial in times when the spaces for dissent are seen to be imperilled and in need of protection.
",Releasing Kafeel Khan,The Indian Express,
77,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"If individuals have been deprived of months and years of their life for no justifiable reason at all, restitution of some sort must be provided. While lost time cannot be returned, and harassment cannot be undone, at the very least, compensation can mitigate some of the harm caused.On September 1, the High Court (HC) of Allahabad passed an order declaring that Dr Kafeel Khan had been wrongly detained by the Uttar Pradesh government, under the National Security Act of 1980. The 42-page order of the court makes for damning reading. It points out that Khan was deprived of the material on the basis of which he could have made representations against his detention; on substance, Khan?s 23-minute speech in Aligarh on December 12, 2019, which formed the basis of his detention, had been misrepresented by the police; taken as a whole, the speech was in support of national unity and peace, instead of seeking to undermine public order or create disunity. Furthermore, Khan had been detained on February 13, 2020 ? a good two months after the speech ? thus implying that there was, at best, a tenuous connection between his intention and any genuine apprehension that he would cause public disorder.

As the HC judgment makes clear, the State had no case that justified keeping Khan in preventive detention, and depriving him of his liberty. In fact, the circumstances ? Khan was served a preventive detention order immediately after he had been granted bail in another case ? strongly suggest that this was vindictive State action. While the eventual judgment setting him at liberty is, therefore, to be welcomed, it is important to remember that at the time of his release, Khan had spent months in jail, all under the stated goal of ?preventing? future crime, and without a trial.

In this respect, however, Khan?s case is not unique or isolated. Earlier this year, the Jammu and Kashmir HC found that many detention orders that had been issued after the effective nullification of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, had no merit at all, and deserved to be quashed. Once again, these orders came after the detainees had already spent many months in prison.
",India needs a law to compensate the wrongly-imprisoned,The Hindustan Times,
78,Allahabad HC order in Dr Kafeel Khan case,"Allahabad High Court on Tuesday quashed the detention of Dr Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act (NSA) and ordered his immediate release, saying the Uttar Pradesh government had done a ?selective reading? of his anti-CAA speech at Aligarh Muslim University.

The medical doctor had called for national integrity and not incited violence, the court observed.

Khan, a critic of the BJP governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh, has been in jail since January.

Although he was granted bail in February, the Aligarh district magistrate invoked the stringent NSA against him with the ratification of the Uttar Pradesh government and continued to keep him in jail.

On Tuesday, quashing Khan?s detention order, the bench of Chief Justice Govind Marhur and Justice Saumitra Dayal Singh said: ?A complete reading of the speech prima facie does not disclose any effort to promote hatred or violence. It also nowhere threatens peace and tranquillity of the city of Aligarh. The address gives a call for national integrity and unity among the citizens. The speech also deprecates any kind of violence. It appears that the district magistrate had selective reading and selective mention for few phrases from the speech ignoring its true intent.?

The court was hearing a writ petition filed by Khan?s mother Nuzhat Parveen challenging the doctor?s detention against the NSA. Parveen had initially moved the Supreme Court, which transferred the case to Allahabad High Court.

Khan had addressed students at AMU on December 12 last year during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The court noted that he had been arrested on the charges of ?provoking religious sentiments? and attempting to ?incite hatred, enmity and disharmony? to cause an ?adverse impact on the harmony between the communities? and disturb public peace.

The high court said Khan?s detention under the NSA after being granted bail by a competent court in February was illegal. A person can be held without trial for 12 months under the NSA. Khan is lodged in Mathura jail.

Allahabad High Court said that a ?causal link is found to be missing or completely broken? in the case.

?In the absence of any material indicating that the detainee continued to act in a manner prejudicial to public order from December 12, 2019, up to February 13, 2020 (when Khan was booked under the NSA), or that he committed any such? further act as may have had that effect, the preventive detention order cannot be sustained,? the court said.

The court added: ?In fact, the grounds of detention are silent as to public order at Aligarh being at risk of any prejudice in February 2020 on account of the offending act attributed to the detainee on the date December 12, 2019.

?What remains is a mere apprehension expressed by the detaining authority without supporting material on which such apprehension may be founded.?

The court noted that Khan had during the AMU speech said that ?Mota Bhai? ? elder brother in Gujarati and a term sometimes used to refer to Amit Shah and Narendra Modi ? wanted to see people either as Hindu or Muslim, that crores would be spent to send people to detention centres and that the healthcare system had broken down. The court noted that Khan had said ?they talk about shamshaan-kabristan, Ali-Bajrang Bali, your Kashmir, Ram Mandir, CAB, NRC. They don?t talk about the promise that they made for 2 crore jobs per year. They don?t talk about giving Rs 15 lakh to us as earlier said by them. The economy is doomed, small businessmen are ruined.?

Explaining why Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath had targeted him, Khan had said: ?The talk about nationalism is actually pseudo-nationalism, on the basis of pseudo-Hinduism only.?

The court said Khan was given a compact disk containing his speech at AMU for him to prepare his representation but no player was made available.

?The grounds for detention along with material were supplied to the detainee in light of Clause (5) of Article 22 of the Constitution, enabling him to submit his representation to the competent authorities at the earliest. The material so given was a compact disk of the speech delivered by Dr Kafeel Khan on 12th December, 2019, at Bab-e-Syed gate of Aligarh Muslim University. On asking, it is conveyed to us that no transcript of the speech was supplied to the detainee. The non-supply of transcript would have been of no consequence if a device would have been supplied to the detainee to play the compact disk. It is the position admitted that no such device was made available to the detainee,? the court noted.

The court observed that the orders extending Khan?s detention were never given to him. ?The record shown to us and the pleadings of the petition also refer that only radiograms relating to the decision of the state government for extension of the term of detention were supplied to the detainee,? it said. ?The radiograms mention that the actual order shall be sent through speed post but in fact nothing except the radiograms were given to the detainee.?

The court added: ?In light of the discussion above, we are having no hesitation in concluding that neither the detention of Dr Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act, 1980, nor the extension of the detention are sustainable in the eye of law,? it said.

The Uttar Pradesh government had in August extended Khan?s detention under the NSA by three months, saying that an advisory council had noted in its report that there were ?enough reasons? to keep him in jail.

?The order of detention dated 13th February, 2020, passed by the district magistrate, Aligarh, and confirmed by the state of Uttar Pradesh is set aside. The extension of the period of detention of? Dr Kafeel Khan is also declared illegal. A writ in the nature of habeas corpus is hereby issued to release Dr Kafeel Khan? from State custody forthwith,? the court said on Tuesday.

Khan had earlier been arrested in 2017 following the deaths of children at Gorakhpur?s Baba Raghav Das Medical College because of lack of oxygen cylinders. Khan had been the nodal officer of the 100-bed encephalitis ward of the medical college. It later emerged that the company that had been assigned to ensure uninterrupted supply of liquid oxygen had disrupted delivery because of non-payment of dues by the state government. Khan and nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital had been arrested and later granted bail.

An Uttar Pradesh government committee had later absolved Khan of any wrongdoing. The doctor had then alleged that chief minister Adityanath did not like him because he had spoken the truth about the case.
